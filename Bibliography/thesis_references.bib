	abstract = {TDP‐43 (encoded by the gene TARDBP ) is an RNA binding protein central to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, how TARDBP mutations trigger pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we use novel mouse mutants carrying point mutations in endogenous Tardbp to dissect TDP‐43 function at physiological levels both in vitro and in vivo . Interestingly, we find that mutations within the C‐terminal domain of TDP‐43 lead to a gain of splicing function. Using two different strains, we are able to separate TDP‐43 loss‐ and gain‐of‐function effects. TDP‐43 gain‐of‐function effects in these mice reveal a novel category of splicing events controlled by TDP‐43, referred to as “skiptic” exons, in which skipping of constitutive exons causes changes in gene expression. In vivo , this gain‐of‐function mutation in endogenous Tardbp causes an adult‐onset neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron loss and neurodegenerative changes. Furthermore, we have validated the splicing gain‐of‐function and skiptic exons in ALS patient‐derived cells. Our findings provide a novel pathogenic mechanism and highlight how TDP‐43 gain of function and loss of function affect RNA processing differently, suggesting they may act at different disease stages.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing shapes mammalian transcriptomes, with many RNA molecules undergoing multiple distant alternative splicing events. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis, including analysis of exon co-association in the same molecule, requires deep, long-read sequencing. Here we introduce an RNA sequencing method, synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq), in which small pools ([le]1,000 molecules/pool, [le]1 molecule/gene for most genes) of full-length cDNAs are amplified, fragmented and short-read-sequenced. We demonstrate that these RNA sequences reconstructed from the short reads from each of the pools are mostly close to full length and contain few insertion and deletion errors. We report many previously undescribed isoforms (human brain: [sim]13,800 affected genes, 14.5{\%} of molecules; mouse brain [sim]8,600 genes, 18{\%} of molecules) and up to 165 human distant molecularly associated exon pairs (dMAPs) and distant molecularly and mutually exclusive pairs (dMEPs). Of 16 associated pairs detected in the mouse brain, 9 are conserved in human. Our results indicate conserved mechanisms that can produce distant but phased features on transcript and proteome isoforms.},

	abstract = {Mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) strongly implicate ubiquitously expressed regulators of RNA processing. To understand the molecular impact of ALS-causing mutations on neuronal development and disease, we analysed transcriptomes during in vitro differentiation of motor neurons (MNs) from human control and patient-specific VCP mutant induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We identify increased intron retention (IR) as a dominant feature of the splicing programme during early neural differentiation. Importantly, IR occurs prematurely in VCP mutant cultures compared with control counterparts. These aberrant IR events are also seen in independent RNAseq data sets from SOD1- and FUS-mutant MNs. The most significant IR is seen in the SFPQ transcript. The SFPQ protein binds extensively to its retained intron, exhibits lower nuclear abundance in VCP mutant cultures and is lost from nuclei of MNs in mouse models and human sporadic ALS. Collectively, we demonstrate SFPQ IR and nuclear loss as molecular hallmarks of familial and sporadic ALS.},

One mechanism that contributes to splicing fidelity is the repression of nonconserved cryptic exons by splicing factors that recognize dinucleotide repeats. We previously identified that TDP-43 and PTBP1/PTBP2 are capable of repressing cryptic exons utilizing UG and CU repeats, respectively. Here we demonstrate that hnRNP L (HNRNPL) also represses cryptic exons by utilizing exonic CA repeats, particularly near the 5'SS.

	abstract = {Chemosensory systems play vital roles in the lives of most mammals, including the detection and identification of predators, as well as sex and reproductive status and the identification of individual conspecifics. All of these capabilities require a process of recognition involving a combination of innate (kairomonal/pheromonal) and learned responses. Across very different phylogenies, the mechanisms for pheromonal and odour learning have much in common. They are frequently associated with plasticity of GABA-ergic feedback at the initial level of processing the chemosensory information, which enhances its pattern separation capability. Association of odourant features into an odour object primarily involves anterior piriform cortex for non-social odours. However, the medial amygdala appears to be involved in both the recognition of social odours and their association with chemosensory information sensed by the vomeronasal system. Unusually not only the sensory neurons themselves, but also the GABA-ergic interneurons in the olfactory bulb are continually being replaced, with implications for the induction and maintenance of learned chemosensory responses.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43-the major protein component of neuronal aggregates characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies-have been linked to familial forms of both disorders. Aggregates of TDP-43 in cortical and spinal motorneurons in ALS, or in neurons of the frontal and temporal cortices in FTLD, are closely linked to neuron loss and atrophy in these areas. However, the mechanism by which TDP-43 mutations lead to neurodegeneration is unclear. To investigate the pathogenic role of TDP-43 mutations, we established a model of TDP-43 proteinopathies by expressing fluorescently tagged wild-type and mutant TDP-43 in primary rat cortical neurons. Expression of mutant TDP-43 was toxic to neurons, and mutant-specific toxicity was associated with increased cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43. Inclusion bodies were not necessary for the toxicity and did not affect the risk of cell death. Cellular survival was unaffected by the total amount of exogenous TDP-43 in the nucleus, but the amount of cytoplasmic TDP-43 was a strong and independent predictor of neuronal death. These results suggest that mutant TDP-43 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, where it exhibits a toxic gain-of-function and induces cell death.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA instability disorders are responsible for a large clinical spectrum, among which amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like symptoms and frontotemporal dementia are extremely rare. We report a large family with a late-onset phenotype including motor neuron disease, cognitive decline resembling frontotemporal dementia, cerebellar ataxia and myopathy. In all patients, muscle biopsy showed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres with combined respiratory chain deficiency and abnormal assembly of complex V. The multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions found in skeletal muscle revealed a mitochondrial DNA instability disorder. Patient fibroblasts present with respiratory chain deficiency, mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, expression of matrix-targeted photoactivatable GFP showed that mitochondrial fusion was not inhibited in patient fibroblasts. Using whole-exome sequencing we identified a missense mutation (c.176C{\textgreater}T; p.Ser59Leu) in the CHCHD10 gene that encodes a coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix protein, whose function is unknown. We show that CHCHD10 is a mitochondrial protein located in the intermembrane space and enriched at cristae junctions. Overexpression of a CHCHD10 mutant allele in HeLa cells led to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and ultrastructural major abnormalities including loss, disorganization and dilatation of cristae. The observation of a frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype in a mitochondrial disease led us to analyse CHCHD10 in a cohort of 21 families with pathologically proven frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We identified the same missense p.Ser59Leu mutation in one of these families. This work opens a novel field to explore the pathogenesis of the frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical spectrum by showing that mitochondrial disease may be at the origin of some of these phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic and usually fatal disorder caused by motor-neuron degeneration in the brain and spinal cord. Most cases of ALS are sporadic but about 5-10{\%} are familial. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS, also known as translocated in liposarcoma (TLS)) account for approximately 30{\%} of classic familial ALS. Mutations in several other genes have also been reported as rare causes of ALS or ALS-like syndromes. The causes of the remaining cases of familial ALS and of the vast majority of sporadic ALS are unknown. Despite extensive studies of previously identified ALS-causing genes, the pathogenic mechanism underlying motor-neuron degeneration in ALS remains largely obscure. Dementia, usually of the frontotemporal lobar type, may occur in some ALS cases. It is unclear whether ALS and dementia share common aetiology and pathogenesis in ALS/dementia. Here we show that mutations in UBQLN2, which encodes the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin 2, cause dominantly inherited, chromosome-X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. We describe novel ubiquilin 2 pathology in the spinal cords of ALS cases and in the brains of ALS/dementia cases with or without UBQLN2 mutations. Ubiquilin 2 is a member of the ubiquilin family, which regulates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Functional analysis showed that mutations in UBQLN2 lead to an impairment of protein degradation. Therefore, our findings link abnormalities in ubiquilin 2 to defects in the protein degradation pathway, abnormal protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has its onset in middle age and is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the primary motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10{\%} are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30{\%} of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.},

We performed exome sequencing of 252 familial ALS (fALS) and 827 control individuals. Gene-based rare variant analysis identified an exome-wide significant enrichment of eight loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in TBK1 (encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) in 13 fALS pedigrees. No enrichment of LoF mutations was observed in a targeted mutation screen of 1,010 sporadic ALS and 650 additional control individuals. Linkage analysis in four families gave an aggregate LOD score of 4.6. In vitro experiments confirmed the loss of expression of TBK1 LoF mutant alleles, or loss of interaction of the C-terminal TBK1 coiled-coil domain (CCD2) mutants with the TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin, which has been shown to be involved in ALS pathogenesis. We conclude that haploinsufficiency of TBK1 causes ALS and fronto-temporal dementia.},

Here we show that ataxin 2 (ATXN2), a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is a potent modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in animal and cellular models. ATXN2 and TDP-43 associate in a complex that depends on RNA. In spinal cord neurons of ALS patients, ATXN2 is abnormally localized; likewise, TDP-43 shows mislocalization in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. To assess the involvement of ATXN2 in ALS, we analysed the length of the polyQ repeat in the ATXN2 gene in 915 ALS patients. We found that intermediate-length polyQ expansions (27-33 glutamines) in ATXN2 were significantly associated with ALS. These data establish ATXN2 as a relatively common ALS susceptibility gene. Furthermore, these findings indicate that the TDP-43-ATXN2 interaction may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.},

We have used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods to characterize the molecular structure of self-assembling fibrils formed by the LC domain of the fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA-binding protein. From the 214-residue LC domain of FUS (FUS-LC), a segment of only 57 residues forms the fibril core, while other segments remain dynamically disordered. Unlike pathogenic amyloid fibrils, FUS-LC fibrils lack hydrophobic interactions within the core and are not polymorphic at the molecular structural level. Phosphorylation of core-forming residues by DNA-dependent protein kinase blocks binding of soluble FUS-LC to FUS-LC hydrogels and dissolves phase-separated, liquid-like FUS-LC droplets. These studies offer a structural basis for understanding LC domain self-assembly, phase separation, and regulation by post-translational modification. Solid-state NMR of FUS fibrils provides structural insight into phase separation of low-complexity domains and its regulation by post-translational modification.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: FUS, EWS and TAF15 are structurally similar multifunctional proteins that were first discovered upon characterization of fusion oncogenes in human sarcomas and leukemias. The proteins belong to the FET (previously TET) family of RNA-binding proteins and are implicated in central cellular processes such as regulation of gene expression, maintenance of genomic integrity and mRNA/microRNA processing. In the present study, we investigated the expression and cellular localization of FET proteins in multiple human tissues and cell types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: FUS, EWS and TAF15 were expressed in both distinct and overlapping patterns in human tissues. The three proteins showed almost ubiquitous nuclear expression and FUS and TAF15 were in addition present in the cytoplasm of most cell types. Cytoplasmic EWS was more rarely detected and seen mainly in secretory cell types. Furthermore, FET expression was downregulated in differentiating human embryonic stem cells, during induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells and absent in terminally differentiated melanocytes and cardiac muscle cells. The FET proteins were targeted to stress granules induced by heat shock and oxidative stress and FUS required its RNA-binding domain for this translocation. Furthermore, FUS and TAF15 were detected in spreading initiation centers of adhering cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results point to cell-specific expression patterns and functions of the FET proteins rather than the housekeeping roles inferred from earlier studies. The localization of FET proteins to stress granules suggests activities in translational regulation during stress conditions. Roles in central processes such as stress response, translational control and adhesion may explain the FET proteins frequent involvement in human cancer.},

Identities of other inclusion proteins associated with TDP-43 aggregation remain poorly defined. In this study, we identify and quantitate 35 co-aggregating proteins in the detergent-resistant fraction of HEK-293 cells in which TDP-43 or a particularly aggregate prone variant, TDP-S6, were enriched following overexpression, using stable isotope-labeled (SILAC) internal standards and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We also searched for differential post-translational modification (PTM) sites of ubiquitination. Four sites of ubiquitin conjugation to TDP-43 or TDP-S6 were confirmed by dialkylated GST-TDP-43 external reference peptides, occurring on or near RNA binding motif (RRM) 1. RRM-containing proteins co-enriched in cytoplasmic granular structures in HEK-293 cells and primary motor neurons with insoluble TDP-S6, including cytoplasmic stress granule associated proteins G3BP, PABPC1, and eIF4A1. Proteomic evidence for TDP-43 co-aggregation with paraspeckle markers RBM14, PSF and NonO was also validated by western blot and by immunocytochemistry in HEK-293 cells. An increase in peptides from methylated arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) RNA-binding motifs of FUS/TLS and hnRNPs was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction of TDP-overexpressing cells. Finally, TDP-43 and TDP-S6 detergent-insoluble species were reduced by mutagenesis of the identified ubiquitination sites, even following oxidative or proteolytic stress. Together, these findings define some of the aggregation partners of TDP-43, and suggest that TDP-43 ubiquitination influences TDP-43 oligomerization.},

In ALS and FTLD-U, aggregated, ubiquitinated, and N-terminally truncated TDP-43 can be isolated from brain tissue rich in neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The loss of TDP-43 function resulting from inappropriate cleavage, translocation from the nucleus, or its sequestration into inclusions could play important roles in neurodegeneration. How-ever, it is not known whether TDP-43 fragments directly mediate toxicity and, more specifically, whether their abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis. We report that the ectopic expression of a Ϸ25-kDa TDP-43 fragment corresponding to the C-terminal truncation product of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 leads to the formation of toxic, insoluble, and ubiquitin-and phospho-positive cytoplasmic inclusions within cells. The 25-kDa C-terminal fragment is more prone to phosphorylation at S409/S410 than full-length TDP-43, but phosphorylation at these sites is not required for inclusion formation or toxicity. Although this fragment shows no biological activity, its exogenous expression neither inhibits the function nor causes the sequestration of full-length nuclear TDP-43, suggesting that the 25-kDa fragment can induce cell death through a toxic gain-of-function. Finally, by generating a conformation-dependent antibody that detects C-terminal fragments, we show that this toxic cleavage product is specific for pathologic inclusions in human TDP-43 proteinopathies.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene cause a subset of familial ALS cases and are also implicated in sporadic ALS. FUS is typically localized to the nucleus. The ALS-related FUS mutations cause cytoplasmic mis-localization and the formation of stress granule-like structures. Abnormal cytoplasmic FUS localization was also found in a subset of frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) cases without FUS mutations. To better understand the function of FUS, we performed wild-type and mutant FUS pull-downs followed by proteomic identification of the interacting proteins. The FUS interacting partners we identified are involved in multiple pathways, including chromosomal organization, transcription, RNA splicing, RNA transport, localized translation, and stress response. FUS interacted with hnRNPA1 and Matrin-3, RNA binding proteins whose mutations were also reported to cause familial ALS, suggesting that hnRNPA1 and Matrin-3 may play common pathogenic roles with FUS. The FUS interactions displayed varied RNA dependence. Numerous FUS interacting partners that we identified are components of exosomes. We found that FUS itself was present in exosomes, suggesting that the secretion of FUS might contribute to the cell-to-cell spreading of FUS pathology. FUS interacting proteins were sequestered into the cytoplasmic mutant FUS inclusions that could lead to their mis-regulation or loss of function, contributing to ALS pathogenesis. Our results provide insights into the physiological functions of FUS as well as important pathways where mutant FUS can interfere with cellular processes and potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS.},

	abstract = {Proteinaceous inclusions are common hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases. TDP-43 proteinopathies, consisting of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by inclusion bodies formed by polyubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated full-length and truncated TDP-43. The structural properties of TDP-43 aggregates and their relationship to pathogenesis are still ambiguous. Here we demonstrate that the recombinant full-length human TDP-43 forms structurally stable, spherical oligomers that share common epitopes with an anti-amyloid oligomer-specific antibody. The TDP-43 oligomers are stable, have exposed hydrophobic surfaces, exhibit reduced DNA binding capability and are neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TDP-43 oligomers are capable of cross-seeding Alzheimer's amyloid-b to form amyloid oligomers, demonstrating interconvertibility between the amyloid species. Such oligomers are present in the forebrain of transgenic TDP-43 mice and FTLD-TDP patients. Our results suggest that aside from filamentous aggregates, TDP-43 oligomers may play a role in TDP-43 pathogenesis. DOI: 10.1038/ncomms5824 1},

	abstract = {TDP-43 and FUS are RNA-binding proteins that form cytoplasmic inclusions in some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Moreover, mutations in TDP-43 and FUS are linked to ALS and FTLD. However, it is unknown whether TDP-43 and FUS aggregate and cause toxicity by similar mechanisms. Here, we exploit a yeast model and purified FUS to elucidate mechanisms of FUS aggregation and toxicity. Like TDP-43, FUS must aggregate in the cytoplasm and bind RNA to confer toxicity in yeast. These cytoplasmic FUS aggregates partition to stress granule compartments just as they do in ALS patients. Importantly, in isolation, FUS spontaneously forms pore-like oligomers and filamentous structures reminiscent of FUS inclusions in ALS patients. FUS aggregation and toxicity requires a prion-like domain, but unlike TDP-43, additional determinants within a RGG domain are critical for FUS aggregation and toxicity. In further distinction to TDP-43, ALS-linked FUS mutations do not promote aggregation. Finally, genome-wide screens uncovered stress granule assembly and RNA metabolism genes that modify FUS toxicity but not TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings suggest that TDP-43 and FUS, though similar RNA-binding proteins, aggregate and confer disease phenotypes via distinct mechanisms. These differences will likely have important therapeutic implications.},

	abstract = {It has been recently demonstrated that the 43-kDa transactive response (TAR)-DNA-binding protein (TARDBP) is the neuropathological hallmark of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions. Large series of FTD patients without motor neuron disease have been previously analysed, but no TARDBP mutation was identified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether TARDBP gene mutations may be associated with FTD. We report that a pathogenetic TARDBP mutation is causative of behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD). An aged woman in her seventies initially started to present apathy and depression associated with impairment in executive functions. The diagnosis of bvFTD (apathetic syndrome) was accomplished by three-year follow-up, and structural and functional neuroimaging. By five-years after onset, extensive electrophysiological investigations excluded subclinical motor neuron disease. In this patient, a single base substitution c.800A{\textgreater}G of TARDBP gene was identified. This mutation, already described as causative of ALS, predicted the amino acidic change arginine to serine at position 267 (N267S). In silico analysis demonstrated that this substitution generates a new phosphorylation site, and western blot analysis on lymphoblastoid cells reported a decrease of protein expression in N267S mutation carrier. Our study suggests that TARDBP mutations can be pathogenetic of bvFTD without motor neuron disease. TARDBP screening needs to be considered in FTD cases. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Tan2016,
	abstract = {Splicing regulation is an important step of post-transcriptional gene regulation. It is a highly dynamic process orchestrated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBP dysfunction and global splicing dysregulation have been implicated in many human diseases, but the in vivo functions of most RBPs and the splicing outcome upon their loss remain largely unexplored. Here we report that constitutive deletion of Rbm17, which encodes an RBP with a putative role in splicing, causes early embryonic lethality in mice and that its loss in Purkinje neurons leads to rapid degeneration. Transcriptome profiling of Rbm17-deficient and control neurons and subsequent splicing analyses using CrypSplice, a new computational method that we developed, revealed that more than half of RBM17-dependent splicing changes are cryptic. Importantly, RBM17 represses cryptic splicing of genes that likely contribute to motor coordination and cell survival. This finding prompted us to re-analyze published datasets from a recent report on TDP-43, an RBP implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as it was demonstrated that TDP-43 represses cryptic exon splicing to promote cell survival. We uncovered a large number of TDP-43-dependent splicing defects that were not previously discovered, revealing that TDP-43 extensively regulates cryptic splicing. Moreover, we found a significant overlap in genes that undergo both RBM17- and TDP-43-dependent cryptic splicing repression, many of which are associated with survival. We propose that repression of cryptic splicing by RBPs is critical for neuronal health and survival.},

	abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

However, the determinants of TDP-43 localization and the cellular insults that promote redistribution are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the putative Nuclear Export Signal (NES) is not required for nuclear egress of TDP-43. Moreover, when the TDP-43 domain which contains the putative NES is fused to a reporter protein, YFP, the presence of the NES is not sufficient to mediate nuclear exclusion of the fusion protein. We find that the previously studied “∆NES” mutant, in which conserved hydrophobic residues are mutated to alanines, disrupts both solubility and splicing function. We further show that nuclear export of TDP-43 is independent of the exportin XPO1. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear egress of TDP-43 is size dependent; nuclear export of dTomato TDP-43 is significantly impaired compared to Flag TDP-43. Together, these results suggest nuclear export of TDP-43 is predominantly driven by passive diffusion.},

TDP-43 expression was markedly upregulated in axotomized motor neurons, with prominent cytosolic immunoreactivity becoming maximal by post-injury day 7 and returning to baseline levels by post-injury day 28. Increased TDP-43 expression was confirmed by western blot. TDP-43 mRNA expression was also increased. This was inversely correlated with neuronal PGRN expression which was clearly reduced by day 7 with a return to baseline by post-injury day 28. In contrast, microglial PGRN expression was dramatically increased, and correlated with the inflammatory response to axotomy. Cytosolic TDP-43 colocalized with Staufen and TIA-1, markers for RNA transport and stress granules respectively. We did not observe colocalization of TDP-43 or PGRN with degradative granules (P-bodies) or activated caspase 3. These results indicate that TDP-43 expression is altered in response to neuronal injury and that normal expression is restored following recovery. These findings suggest that the upregulation of TDP-43 expression with prominent cytosolic localization in motor neurons injured by degenerative processes such as ALS may actually represent an appropriate response to neuronal injury. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Impairment of learning and memory is a significant pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including FTLD-TDP. Appropriate regulation and fine tuning of spinogenesis of the dendrites, which is an integral part of the learning/memory program of the mammalian brain, are essential for the normal function of the hippocampal neurons. TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein implicated in multi-cellular functions and in the pathogenesis of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including FTLD-TDP and ALS. We have combined the use of single-cell dye injection, shRNA knockdown, plasmid rescue, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot analysis and patch clamp electrophysiological measurement of primary mouse hippocampal neurons in culture to study the functional role of TDP-43 in mammalian spinogenesis. We found that depletion of TDP-43 leads to an increase in the number of protrusions/spines as well as the percentage of matured spines among the protrusions. Significantly, the knockdown of TDP-43 also increases the level of Rac1 and its activated form GTP-Rac1, a known positive regulator of spinogenesis. Clustering of the AMPA receptors on the dendritic surface and neuronal firing are also induced by depletion of TDP-43. Furthermore, use of an inhibitor of Rac1 activation negatively regulated spinogenesis of control hippocampal neurons as well as TDP-43-depleted hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, RT-PCR assay and cycloheximide chase experiments have indicated that increases in Rac1 protein upon TDP-43 depletion is regulated at the translational level. These data together establish that TDP-43 is an upstream regulator of spinogenesis in part through its action on the Rac1 → GTP-Rac1 → AMPAR pathway. This study provides the first evidence connecting TDP-43 with the GTP-Rac1 → AMPAR regulatory pathway of spinogenesis. It establishes that mis-metabolism of TDP-43, as occurs in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathies, e.g., FTLD-TDP, would alter its homeostatic cellular concentration, thus leading to impairment of hippocampal plasticity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) is deposited as cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous studies reported that abnormal phosphorylation takes place in deposited TDP-43. The aim of this study was to identify the phosphorylation sites and responsible kinases, and to clarify the pathological significance of phosphorylation of TDP-43.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We generated multiple antibodies specific to phosphorylated TDP-43 by immunizing phosphopeptides of TDP-43, and analyzed FTLD-U and ALS brains by immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblots. In addition, we performed investigations aimed at identifying the responsible kinases, and we assessed the effects of phosphorylation on TDP-43 oligomerization and fibrillization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified multiple phosphorylation sites in carboxyl-terminal regions of deposited TDP-43. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies stained more inclusions than antibodies to ubiquitin and, unlike existing commercially available anti-TDP-43 antibodies, did not stain normal nuclei. Ultrastructurally, these antibodies labeled abnormal fibers of 15nm diameter and on immunoblots recognized hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 at 45kDa, with additional 18 to 26kDa fragments in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from FTLD-U and ALS brains. The phosphorylated epitopes were generated by casein kinase-1 and -2, and phosphorylation led to increased oligomerization and fibrillization of TDP-43.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: These results suggest that phosphorylated TDP-43 is a major component of the inclusions, and that abnormal phosphorylation of TDP-43 is a critical step in the pathogenesis of FTLD-U and ALS. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies will be powerful tools for the investigation of these disorders.},

	abstract = {The transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a major component of the abnormal intracellular inclusions that occur in two common neurodegenerative diseases of humans: (1) a subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and (2) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetics, experiments in cultured cells and animals, and analogy with other neurodegenerative diseases indicate that the process of TDP-43 aggregation is fundamental to the pathogenesis of these 2 diseases, but the process by which this aggregation occurs is not understood. Biochemical fractionation has revealed truncated, phosphorylated and ubiquitinated forms of TDP-43 in a detergent-insoluble fraction from diseased CNS tissue, while these forms are absent from controls. However, a large amount of the normally predominant 43-kDa form of TDP-43 is present in the detergent-insoluble fraction even from control brains, so it has not been possible to determine if this form of TDP-43 is part of pathological aggregates in frontotemporal lobe degeneration. We used semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis to isolate high molecular weight aggregates containing TDP-43 that are present in the cerebral cortex of individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration but not that of controls. These aggregates include the same covalently modified forms of TDP-43 seen in detergent-insoluble extracts. In addition, aggregates include a 43-kDa TDP-43 species. This aggregated 43-kDa form of TDP-43 is absent or present only at low levels in controls. The presence of 43-kDa TDP-43 in aggregates raises the possibility that covalent modification is not a primary step in the pathogenic aggregation of TDP-43 associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

Using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses, we have identified a TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a nuclear factor that functions in regulating transcription and alternative splicing, as a component of these structures in FTLD. Furthermore, skein-like inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and glial inclusions in the spinal cord of ALS patients are also positive for TDP-43. Dephosphorylation treatment of the sarkosyl insoluble fraction has shown that abnormal phosphorylation takes place in accumulated TDP-43.

The C-terminal domain of TDP-43 is critical for spontaneous aggregation. Several ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations within this domain (Q331K, M337V, Q343R, N345K, R361S, and N390D) increase the number of TDP-43 aggregates and pro-mote toxicity in vivo.

Cytoplasmic inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43 are a pathological hallmark of ALS, and mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 have been directly linked to the development of the disease. TDP-43 is a ubiquitous DNA/RNA-binding protein with a nuclear role in pre-mRNA splicing. However, the selective vulnerability and axonal degeneration of motor neurons in ALS pose the question of whether TDP-43 may have an additional role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic and axonal fate of mRNAs, processes important for neuron function. To investigate this possibility, we have char-acterized TDP-43 localization and dynamics in primary cultured motor neurons. Using a combination of cell imaging and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that TDP-43 is localized and actively transported in live motor neuron axons, and that it co-localizes with well-studied axonal mRNA-binding proteins. Expression of the TDP-43 C-terminal fragment led to the formation of hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated inclusions in motor neuron cell bodies and neurites, and these inclusions specifically sequestered the mRNA-binding pro-tein HuD. Additionally, we showed that overexpression of full-length or mutant TDP-43 in motor neurons caused a severe impairment in axon outgrowth, which was dependent on the C-terminal protein-interacting domain of TDP-43. Taken together, our results suggest a role of TDP-43 in the regulation of axonal growth, and suggest that impairment in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs in the cytoplasm of motor neu-rons may be a major factor in the development of ALS.},

We have developed an experimental system for visualising the perturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport of neuronal TDP-43 at the single-cell level in vivo using zebrafish spinal cord. This approach enabled us to image TDP-43-expressing motor neurons before and after experimental initiation of cell death. We report the formation of mobile TDP-43 deposits within degenerating motor neurons, which are normally phagocytosed by microglia. However, when microglial cells were depleted, injury-induced motor neuron degeneration follows a characteristic process that includes TDP-43 redistribution into the cytoplasm, axon and extracellular space. This is the first demonstration of perturbed TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport in vivo, and suggests that impairment in microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons may contribute towards the formation of pathological TDP-43 presentations in ALS and FTLD.},

We developed a novel protein complementation assay allowing quantification of TDP-43 oligomers in living cells. We demonstrate the exchange of TDP-43 between cell somata and the presence of TDP-43 oligomers in microvesicles/exosomes and show that microvesicular TDP-43 is preferentially taken up by recipient cells where it exerts higher toxicity than free TDP-43. Moreover, studies using microfluidic neuronal cultures suggest both anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic spreading of TDP-43. Finally, we demonstrate TDP-43 oligomer seeding by TDP-43-containing material derived from both cultured cells and ALS patient brain lysate. Thus, using an innovative detection technique, we provide evidence for preferentially microvesicular uptake as well as both soma-to-soma "horizontal" and bidirectional "vertical" synaptic intercellular transmission and prion-like seeding of TDP-43.},

Using molecular, cellular and imaging approaches, we show that these two RNA-binding proteins (RBP) co-repress the translation initiation of Rac1, Map1b and GluR1 mRNAs, and consequently the hippocampal spinogenesis. The co-repression occurs through binding of TDP-43 to mRNA(s) at specific UG/GU sequences and recruitment of the inhibitory CYFIP1-FMRP complex by its glycine-rich domain. This novel regulatory scenario could be utilized to silence a significant portion of around 160 common target mRNAs of the two RBPs. The study establishes a functional/physical partnership between FMRP and TDP-43 that mechanistically links several neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.},

Previously, we found that a prion-like domain in the N-terminus of FUS/TLS mediates co-aggregation between FUS/TLS and mutant huntingtin, the gene product of Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we show that heterozygous knockout of FUS/TLS worsened the phenotypes of model mice of (HD, but not spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This difference was correlated with the degree of pathological association between disease proteins and FUS/ TLS. Co-aggregation between FUS/TLS and mutant huntingtin resulted in the depletion of free FUS/TLS protein in HD mice that was detected as a monomer in SDS-PAGE analysis. Recently, we found that FUS/ TLS paralogs, TAF15 and EWS, were up-regulated in homozygous FUS/TLS knockout mice. These two proteins were up-regulated in both HD and FUS/TLS heterozygote mice, and were further elevated in HD-TLS +/− double mutant mice, consistent with the functional impairment of FUS/TLS. These results suggest that FUS/TLS sequestration by co-aggregation is a rate-limiting factor of disease phenotypes of HD and that inclusions may have an adverse aspect, rather than being simply benign or protective. In addition, our results highlight inclusions as repositories of potential modifiers of neurodegeneration. FUS/TLS is an RNA/DNA-binding protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Further, we observed the known R521H mutation in 1 patient with ALS. No FUS mutations were detected in the patients with FTLD-ALS. While insertions/deletions of 2 glycines (G) were suggested to be pathogenic in the initial FUS reports, we observed an identical GG-deletion in 2 healthy individuals and similar G-insertions/deletions in 4 other control individuals, suggesting that G-insertions/deletions within this G-rich region may be tolerated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In a first analysis of FUS in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), we identified a novel FUS missense mutation, M254V, in 1 patient with pure FTLD. At this point, the biologic relevance of this mutation remains elusive. Screening of additional FTLD patient cohorts will be needed to further elucidate the contribution of FUS mutations to FTLD pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 9 is regulated by a combination of cis-acting elements distributed through the exon and both flanking introns (IVS8 and IVS9). Several studies have identified in the IVS8 intron 3' splice site a regulatory element that is composed of a polymorphic (TG)m(T)n repeated sequence. At present, no cellular factors have been identified that recognize this element. We have identified TDP-43, a nuclear protein not previously described to bind RNA, as the factor binding specifically to the (TG)m sequence. Transient TDP-43 overexpression in Hep3B cells results in an increase in exon 9 skipping. This effect is more pronounced with concomitant overexpression of SR proteins. Antisense inhibition of endogenous TDP-43 expression results in increased inclusion of exon 9, providing a new therapeutic target to correct aberrant splicing of exon 9 in CF patients. The clinical and biological relevance of this finding in vivo is demonstrated by our characterization of a CF patient carrying a TG10T9(DeltaF508)/TG13T3(wt) genotype leading to a disease-causing high proportion of exon 9 skipping.},

In this study we report the dissection of the RNA binding properties of TDP-43 and their functional implications in relationship with the splicing process. Our results show that this protein contains two fully functional RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains with distinct RNA/DNA binding characteristics. Interestingly, TDP-43 can bind a minimum number of six UG (or TG) single-stranded dinucleotide stretches, and binding affinity increases with the number of repeats. In particular, the highly conserved Phe residues in the first RRM region play a key role in nucleic acid recognition.},

We performed experiments to perturb Pol II elongation and then globally compared AS patterns with genome-wide Pol II occupancy. RNA binding and RNA processing functions were significantly enriched among the genes with Pol II elongation inhibition-dependent changes in AS. Under conditions that interfere with Pol II elongation, including cell stress, increased Pol II occupancy was detected in the intronic regions flanking the alternative exons in these genes, and these exons generally became more included. A disproportionately high fraction of these exons introduced premature termination codons that elicited nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), thereby further reducing transcript levels. Our results provide evidence that kinetic coupling between transcription, AS, and NMD affords a rapid mechanism by which cells can respond to changes in growth conditions, including cell stress, to coordinate the levels of RNA processing factors with mRNA levels.},

Splicing occurs in the close vicinity of genes and is frequently cotranscriptional. This is consistent with evidence that both processes are coordinated and, in some cases, functionally coupled. This review focuses on the roles of cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate transcription, on constitutive and alternative splicing. We also discuss possible functions in splicing of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) largest subunit, whose participation in other key pre-mRNA processing reactions (capping and cleavage/polyadenylation) is well documented. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.},

Candidate regulatory factors associated with each motif were identified, to recover 24 known and new splicing regulators. Specific domains in selected factors were sufficient to confer intronic-splicing-silencer activity. Many factors bound multiple distinct motifs with similar affinity, and all motifs were recognized by multiple factors, which revealed a complex overlapping network of protein-RNA interactions.

The details of the process observed are in agreement with results from in vitro splicing systems but differ in the more rapid completion of in vivo splicing. For those introns that are removed cotranscriptionally, a series of events is initiated following 3' splice site synthesis, beginning with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle formation at the 3' splice site within 48 sec, intron loop formation within 2 min, and splicing within 3 min. The initiation of the process is correlated with 3' splice site synthesis but is independent of 5' splice site synthesis, the position of the intron within the transcript, and the age or length of the transcript. In some cases, introns are removed from the 5' end of a transcript before introns are synthesized at the 3' end, supporting a possible role for the order of transcription in splice site pairing. In general, our observations are consistent with the 'first-come-first-served' principle of splice site selection, although an observed example of exon skipping indicates that alternative splicing possibilities can be accommodated within this general framework.},

They play key roles in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD (frontotemporal dementia), where they are partially lost from the nucleus and aggregate in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport contribute to this pathology, hence nuclear import of both proteins has been studied in detail. However, their nuclear export routes remain poorly characterized and it is unclear whether aberrant nuclear export contributes to TDP-43 or FUS pathology. Here we show that predicted nuclear export signals in TDP-43 and FUS are non-functional and that both proteins are exported independently of the export receptor CRM1/Exportin-1. Silencing of Exportin-5 or the mRNA export factor Aly/REF, as well as mutations that abrogate RNA-binding do not impair export of TDP-43 and FUS. However, artificially enlarging TDP-43 or FUS impairs their nuclear egress, suggesting that they could leave the nucleus by passive diffusion. Finally, we found that inhibition of transcription causes accelerated nuclear egress of TDP-43, suggesting that newly synthesized RNA retains TDP-43 in the nucleus, limiting its egress into the cytoplasm. Our findings implicate reduced nuclear retention as a possible factor contributing to mislocalization of TDP-43 in ALS/FTD.},

We have analyzed FUS/TLS in a cohort of 52 index cases from seven Italian regions with non-SOD1 and non-TARDBP FALS. We identified a heterozygous c.G1542C missense mutation in a family of northern Italian origin, and a heterozygous c.C1574T missense mutation in a family of Sicilian origin. Both variants are located in exon 15 encoding the RNA-recognition motif, and result in a substitution of an arginine with a serine in position 514 (p.R514S) and substitution of a proline with a leucine at position 525 (p.P525L), respectively. Overall, the two mutations accounted for 3.8{\%} of 52 non-SOD1 and non-TDP43 index cases of FALS. The clinical phenotype was similar within each of the families, with a predominantly upper limb onset in the family carrying the p.R514S mutation and bulbar onset, with very young age and a rapid course in the family carrying the p.P525L mutation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

To identify interacting partners of TLS, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library constructed from mouse hematopoietic cells using the C-terminal region of TLS in the bait plasmid. Two cDNAs encoding members of the serine-arginine (SR) family of proteins were isolated. The first SR protein is the mouse homolog of human splicing factor SC35, and the second SR member is a novel 183-amino acid protein that we term TASR (TLS-associated serine-arginine protein). cDNA cloning of human TASR indicated that mouse and human TASR have identical amino acid sequences. The interactions between TLS and these two SR proteins were confirmed by co-transfection and immunoprecipitation studies. In vivo splicing assays indicated that SC35 and TASR influence splice site selection of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA. TLS may recruit SR splicing factors to specific target genes through interaction with its C-terminal region, and chromosomal translocations that truncate the C-terminal region of TLS may prevent this interaction.

However, the specific disease-causing and/or modifying mechanism mediated by FUS is largely unknown. Here we evaluate intrinsic roles of FUS on synaptic functions and animal behaviours. We find that FUS depletion downregulates GluA1, a subunit of AMPA receptor. FUS binds GluA1 mRNA in the vicinity of the 3' terminus and controls poly (A) tail maintenance, thus regulating stability. GluA1 reduction upon FUS knockdown reduces miniature EPSC amplitude both in cultured neurons and in vivo. FUS knockdown in hippocampus attenuates dendritic spine maturation and causes behavioural aberrations including hyperactivity, disinhibition and social interaction defects, which are partly ameliorated by GluA1 reintroduction. These results highlight the pivotal role of FUS in regulating GluA1 mRNA stability, post-synaptic function and FTLD-like animal behaviours.},

Using transgenic mice expressing a common FALS-associated FUS mutation (FUS-R521C mice), we found that mutant FUS proteins formed a stable complex with WT FUS proteins and interfered with the normal interactions between FUS and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Consequently, FUS-R521C mice exhibited evidence of DNA damage as well as profound dendritic and synaptic phenotypes in brain and spinal cord. To provide insights into these defects, we screened neural genes for nucleotide oxidation and identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) as a target of FUS-R521C-associated DNA damage and RNA splicing defects in mice. Compared with WT FUS, mutant FUS-R521C proteins formed a more stable complex with Bdnf RNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Stabilization of the FUS/Bdnf RNA complex contributed to Bdnf splicing defects and impaired BDNF signaling through receptor TrkB. Exogenous BDNF only partially restored dendrite phenotype in FUS-R521C neurons, suggesting that BDNF-independent mechanisms may contribute to the defects in these neurons. Indeed, RNA-seq analyses of FUS-R521C spinal cords revealed additional transcription and splicing defects in genes that regulate dendritic growth and synaptic functions. Together, our results provide insight into how gain-of-function FUS mutations affect critical neuronal functions.},

	abstract = {TLS/FUS is a nucleic acid-binding protein whose N-terminal half functions as a transcriptional activator domain in fusion oncoproteins found in human leukemias and liposarcomas. Previous reports have suggested a role for TLS/FUS in transcription and splicing processes. Here we report the association of TLS/FUS with the nuclear matrix and investigate its role in splicing. Splicing of two pre-mRNAs was inhibited in a TLS/FUS-immunodepleted extract and could only be partly restored by addition of recombinant TLS/FUS or/and SR proteins, known interaction partners of TLS/FUS. The subsequent analysis of TLS/FUS immunoprecipitates revealed that, in addition to the SR proteins SC35 and SRp75, the splicing factor PTB (hnRNPI) and the splicing coactivator SRm160 are complexed with TLS/FUS, thus explaining the inability to restore splicing completely. Coimmunolocalization confirmed the nuclear matrix association and interaction of TLS/FUS with PTB, SR proteins, and SRm160. Our results suggest that the matrix protein TLS/FUS plays a role in spliceosome assembly. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the RNA binding protein fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although ALS-linked mutations in FUS often lead to a cytosolic mislocalization of the protein, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these mutations remain poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we examined the biochemical, cell biological and functional properties of mutant FUS in neurons. Expression of different FUS mutants (R521C, R521H, P525L) in neurons caused axonal defects. A protein interaction screen performed to explain these phenotypes identified numerous FUS interactors including the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) causing protein survival motor neuron (SMN). Biochemical experiments showed that FUS and SMN interact directly and endogenously, and that this interaction can be regulated by FUS mutations. Immunostaining revealed co-localization of mutant FUS aggregates and SMN in primary neurons. This redistribution of SMN to cytosolic FUS accumulations led to a decrease in axonal SMN. Finally, cell biological experiments showed that overexpression of SMN rescued the axonal defects induced by mutant FUS, suggesting that FUS mutations cause axonal defects through SMN. This study shows that neuronal aggregates formed by mutant FUS protein may aberrantly sequester SMN and concomitantly cause a reduction of SMN levels in the axon, leading to axonal defects. These data provide a functional link between ALS-linked FUS mutations, SMN and neuronal connectivity and support the idea that different motor neuron disorders such as SMA and ALS may be caused, in part, by defects in shared molecular pathways.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in severe muscle weakness and eventual death by respiratory failure. Although little is known about its pathogenesis, mutations in fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS) are causative for familial ALS. FUS is a multifunctional protein that is involved in many aspects of RNA processing. To elucidate the role of FUS in ALS, we overexpressed wild-type and two mutant forms of FUS in HEK-293T cells, as well as knocked-down FUS expression. This was followed by RNA-Seq to identify genes which displayed differential expression or altered splicing patterns. Pathway analysis revealed that overexpression of wild-type FUS regulates ribosomal genes, whereas knock-down of FUS additionally affects expression of spliceosome related genes. Furthermore, cells expressing mutant FUS displayed global transcription patterns more similar to cells overexpressing wild-type FUS than to the knock-down condition. This observation suggests that FUS mutants do not contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS through a loss-of-function. Finally, our results demonstrate that the R521G and R522G mutations display differences in their influence on transcription and splicing. Taken together, these results provide additional insights into the function of FUS and how mutations contribute to the development of ALS.},

We also show that FUS/TLS is recruited to chromatin at sites of their transcription and binds the corresponding pri-microRNAs. Moreover, FUS/TLS depletion leads to decreased Drosha level at the same chromatin loci. Limited FUS/TLS depletion leads to a reduced microRNA biogenesis and we suggest a possible link between FUS mutations affecting nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning of the protein and altered neuronal microRNA biogenesis in ALS pathogenesis.},

In mouse brain, FUS directly binds to Tau pre-mRNA, and knockdown of FUS in hippocampal neurons leads to preferential inclusion of Tau exons 3 and 10. FUS knockdown causes significant growth cone enlargement and disorganization reminiscent of Tau loss of function. These findings suggest that disturbed cytoskeletal function and enhanced expression of the neurodegeneration-associated Tau exon 10 might contribute to FTLD/ALS with FUS inclusions.},

A major question is whether neuronal loss is caused by toxic gain-of-function cytoplasmic aggregates or loss of nuclear RNA-binding protein function. We generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing exogenous FUS without a nuclear localization signal ($\Delta$NLS-FUS), which developed progressive spastic motor deficits and neuronal loss in the motor cortex. The $\Delta$NLS-FUS protein was restricted to the cytoplasm and formed ubiquitin/p62-positive aggregates. Endogenous FUS expression, nuclear localization, and splicing activity were not altered, indicating that mislocated FUS is sufficient for proteinopathy. Crossing $\Delta$NLS-FUS with wild-type human TDP-43 transgenic mice exacerbated pathological and behavioural phenotypes, suggesting that both proteins are involved in a common cascade. RNA-sequence analysis revealed specific transcriptome alterations, including genes regulating dynein-associated molecules and endoplasmic reticulum stress. $\Delta$NLS-FUS mice are promising tools for understanding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis and testing new therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {Cytoplasmic FUS aggregates are a pathological hallmark in a subset of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A key step that is disrupted in these patients is nuclear import of FUS mediated by the import receptor Transportin/Karyopherin-$\beta$2. In ALS-FUS patients, this is caused by mutations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of FUS that weaken Transportin binding. In FTD-FUS patients, Transportin is aggregated, and post-translational arginine methylation, which regulates the FUS-Transportin interaction, is lost. Here, we show that Transportin and arginine methylation have a crucial function beyond nuclear import—namely to suppress RGG/RG-driven phase separation and stress granule association of FUS. ALS-associated FUS-NLS mutations weaken the chaperone activity of Transportin and loss of FUS arginine methylation, as seen in FTD-FUS, promote phase separation, and stress granule partitioning of FUS. Our findings reveal two regulatory mechanisms of liquid-phase homeostasis that are disrupted in FUS-associated neurodegeneration. Phase separation of FUS is regulated by both arginine methylation and binding to the nuclear import receptor Transportin/Karyopherin-$\beta$2, and this control can be compromised in the neurodegenerative diseases FTD and ALS.},

Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-$\beta$2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-$\beta$2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-$\beta$2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-$\beta$2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-$\beta$2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts. Distributed, energetically weak interactions between a karyopherin and the FUS nuclear localization signal disrupt FUS phase separation.},

Several nuclear RBPs with PrLDs, including TDP-43, FUS, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2, mislocalize to cytoplasmic inclusions in neurodegenerative disorders, and mutations in their PrLDs can accelerate fibrillization and cause disease. Here, we establish that nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) specifically chaperone and potently disaggregate wild-type and disease-linked RBPs bearing a NLS. Karyopherin-$\beta$2 (also called Transportin-1) engages PY-NLSs to inhibit and reverse FUS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2 fibrillization, whereas Importin-$\alpha$ plus Karyopherin-$\beta$1 prevent and reverse TDP-43 fibrillization. Remarkably, Karyopherin-$\beta$2 dissolves phase-separated liquids and aberrant fibrillar hydrogels formed by FUS and hnRNPA1. In vivo, Karyopherin-$\beta$2 prevents RBPs with PY-NLSs accumulating in stress granules, restores nuclear RBP localization and function, and rescues degeneration caused by disease-linked FUS and hnRNPA2. Thus, NIRs therapeutically restore RBP homeostasis and mitigate neurodegeneration.

Patients carrying point mutations in the C-terminus of FUS show neuronal cytoplasmic FUS-positive inclusions, whereas in healthy controls, FUS is predominantly nuclear. Cytoplasmic FUS inclusions have also been identified in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-FUS). We show that a non-classical PY nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus of FUS is necessary for nuclear import. The majority of fALS-associated mutations occur within the NLS and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. This presents the first case of disease-causing mutations within a PY-NLS. Nuclear import of FUS is dependent on Transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of FUS into stress granules. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.

	abstract = {FUS is an RNA-binding protein that regulates transcription, alternative splicing, and mRNA transport. Aberrations of FUS are causally associated with familial and sporadic ALS/FTLD. We analyzed FUS-mediated transcriptions and alternative splicing events in mouse primary cortical neurons using exon arrays. We also characterized FUS-binding RNA sites in the mouse cerebrum with HITS-CLIP. We found that FUS-binding sites tend to form stable secondary structures. Analysis of position-dependence of FUS-binding sites disclosed scattered binding of FUS to and around the alternatively spliced exons including those associated with neurodegeneration such as Mapt, Camk2a, and Fmr1. We also found that FUS is often bound to the antisense RNA strand at the promoter regions. Global analysis of these FUS-tags and the expression profiles disclosed that binding of FUS to the promoter antisense strand downregulates transcriptions of the coding strand. Our analysis revealed that FUS regulates alternative splicing events and transcriptions in a position-dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Intron retention (IR) is a form of alternative splicing that can impact mRNA levels through nonsense-mediated decay or by nuclear mRNA detention. A complex, dynamic IR pattern has been described in maturing mammalian granulocytes, but it is unknown whether IR occurs broadly in other hematopoietic lineages. We globally assessed IR in primary maturing mammalian erythroid and megakaryocyte (MK) lineages as well as their common progenitor cells (MEPs). Both lineages exhibit an extensive differential IR program involving hundreds of introns and genes with an overwhelming loss of IR in erythroid cells and MKs compared to MEPs. Moreover, complex IR patterns were seen throughout murine erythroid maturation. Similarly complex patterns were observed in human erythroid differentiation, but not involving the murine orthologous introns or genes. Despite the common origin of erythroid cells and MKs, and overlapping gene expression patterns, the MK IR program is entirely distinct from that of the erythroid lineage with regards to introns, genes, and affected gene ontologies. Importantly, our results suggest that IR serves to broadly regulate mRNA levels. These findings highlight the importance of this understudied form of alternative splicing in gene regulation and provide a useful resource for studies on gene expression in the MK and erythroid lineages.},

	abstract = {We recently characterized human hnRNP L as a global regulator of alternative splicing, binding to CA-repeat and CA-rich elements. Here we report that hnRNP L autoregulates its own expression on the level of alternative splicing. Intron 6 of the human hnRNP L gene contains a short exon that, if used, introduces a premature termination codon, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This "poison exon" is preceded by a highly conserved CA-rich cluster extending over 800 nucleotides that binds hnRNP L and functions as an unusually extended, intronic enhancer, promoting inclusion of the poison exon. As a result, excess hnRNP L activates NMD of its own mRNA, thereby creating a negative autoregulatory feedback loop and contributing to homeostasis of hnRNP L levels. We present experimental evidence for this mechanism, based on NMD inactivation, hnRNP L binding assays, and hnRNP L-dependent alternative splicing of heterologous constructs. In addition, we demonstrate that hnRNP L cross-regulates inclusion of an analogous poison exon in the hnRNP L-like pre-mRNA, which explains the reciprocal expression of the two closely related hnRNP L proteins.},

	abstract = {The Nova family of neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins were originally identified as targets in an autoimmune neurologic disease characterized by failure of motor inhibition. Nova-1 regulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor subunits GABA(A)Rgamma2 and GlyRalpha2 by directly binding intronic elements, resulting in enhancement of exon inclusion. Here we identify exon E4 in the Nova-1 pre-mRNA itself, encoding a phosphorylated protein domain, as an additional target of Nova-dependent splicing regulation in the mouse spinal cord. Nova binding to E4 is necessary and sufficient for Nova-dependent exon exclusion. E4 harbors five repeats of the known Nova-binding tetranucleotide YCAY and mutation of these elements destroys Nova-dependent regulation. Furthermore, swapping of the sites from Nova-1 and GABA(A)Rgamma2 indicates that the ability of Nova to enhance or repress alternative exon inclusion is dependent on the position of the Nova-binding element within the pre-mRNA. These studies demonstrate that in addition to its previously described role as a splicing activator, Nova autoregulates its own expression by acting as a splicing repressor.},

	abstract = {Mutations in FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration remain obscure. We previously found that U1 snRNP is the most abundant FUS interactor. Here, we report that components of the U1 snRNP core particle (Sm proteins and U1 snRNA), but not the mature U1 snRNP-specific proteins (U1-70K, U1A and U1C), co-mislocalize with FUS to the cytoplasm in ALS patient fibroblasts harboring mutations in the FUS nuclear localization signal (NLS). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells expressing the ALS-causing FUS R495X NLS mutation, and mislocalization of Sm proteins is RRM-dependent. Moreover, as observed with FUS, knockdown of any of the U1 snRNP-specific proteins results in a dramatic loss of SMN-containing Gems. Significantly, knockdown of U1 snRNP in zebrafish results in motor axon truncations, a phenotype also observed with FUS, SMN and TDP-43 knockdowns. Our observations linking U1 snRNP to ALS patient cells with FUS mutations, SMN-containing Gems, and motor neurons indicate that U1 snRNP is a component of a molecular pathway associated with motor neuron disease. Linking an essential canonical splicing factor (U1 snRNP) to this pathway provides strong new evidence that splicing defects may be involved in pathogenesis and that this pathway is a potential therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Deep sequencing of embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within polyadenylated transcripts; we classified these as "detained" introns (DIs). We identified thousands of DIs, many of which are evolutionarily conserved, in human and mouse cell lines as well as the adult mouse liver. DIs can have half-lives of over an hour yet remain in the nucleus and are not subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Drug inhibition of Clk, a stress-responsive kinase, triggered rapid splicing changes for a specific subset of DIs; half showed increased splicing, and half showed increased intron detention, altering transcript pools of {\textgreater}300 genes. Srsf4, which undergoes a dramatic phosphorylation shift in response to Clk kinase inhibition, regulates the splicing of some DIs, particularly in genes encoding RNA processing and splicing factors. The splicing of some DIs-including those in Mdm4, a negative regulator of p53-was also altered following DNA damage. After 4 h of Clk inhibition, the expression of {\textgreater}400 genes changed significantly, and almost one-third of these are p53 transcriptional targets. These data suggest a widespread mechanism by which the rate of splicing of DIs contributes to the level of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Many alternative splicing events create RNAs with premature stop codons, suggesting that alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD) may regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. We tested this idea in mice by blocking NMD and measuring changes in isoform representation using splicing-sensitive microarrays. We found a striking class of highly conserved stop codon-containing exons whose inclusion renders the transcript sensitive to NMD. A genomic search for additional examples identified{\textgreater}50 such exons in genes with a variety of functions. These exons are unusually frequent in genes that encode splicing activators and are unexpectedly enriched in the so-called "ultraconserved" elements in the mammalian lineage. Further analysis show that NMD of mRNAs for splicing activators such as SR proteins is triggered by splicing activation events, whereas NMD of the mRNAs for negatively acting hnRNP proteins is triggered by splicing repression, a polarity consistent with widespread homeostatic control of splicing regulator gene expression. We suggest that the extreme genomic conservation surrounding these regulatory splicing events within splicing factor genes demonstrates the evolutionary importance of maintaining tightly tuned homeostasis of RNA-binding protein levels in the vertebrate cell.},

@article{Yu2015b,
	abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is coupled to transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). We previously showed that U1 small nuclear ribonu-cleoprotein (snRNP) associates with RNAP II, and both RNAP II and U1 snRNP are also the most abundant factors associated with the protein fused-in-sarcoma (FUS), which is mutated to cause the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we show that an antisense morpholino that base-pairs to the 5′ end of U1 snRNA blocks splicing in the coupled system and com-pletely disrupts the association between U1 snRNP and both FUS and RNAP II, but has no effect on the association between FUS and RNAP II. Conversely, we found that U1 snRNP does not interact with RNAP II in FUS knockdown extracts. Moreover, using these extracts, we found that FUS must be present during the transcrip-tion reaction in order for splicing to occur. Together, our data lead to a model that FUS functions in coupling transcription to splicing via mediating an interaction between RNAP II and U1 snRNP. ALS | coupling transcription to splicing | RNA polymerase II | U1 snRNP I t is now well established that the steps in gene expression are extensively coupled to one another, including both physical and functional coupling between RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription and pre-mRNA processing (1–11). Moreover, the majority of nascent transcripts are spliced cotranscriptionally, while the transcripts are still tethered to RNAP II. In vitro sys-tems have been developed for the coupled transcription/splicing (txn/splicing) reaction as well as for cotranscriptional splicing, and these systems have been used to investigate the mechanisms underlying these processes (12–17). In the case of coupled txn/ splicing, studies using the in vitro system revealed that tran-scription potently enhances spliceosome assembly, which in turn leads to a strong enhancement of the splicing reaction (13). Additional studies revealed that the only essential splicing fac-tors that copurify with RNAP II are U1 small nuclear ribonu-cleoprotein (snRNP) and its associated factors, the serine/ arginine-rich (SR) proteins (18–20). This observation is partic-ularly noteworthy because U1 snRNP/SR proteins are the first splicing factors that bind to pre-mRNA during spliceosome as-sembly (21). Although functional studies indicate that SR pro-teins play a key role in coupling transcription to splicing (19), the role of U1 snRNP in this coupling event has not been examined. It is also not known how U1 snRNP interacts with RNAP II. U1 snRNA is known to base-pair to the 5′ splice site during the earliest steps in spliceosome assembly, and this interaction is essential for splice-site recognition (21). In addition, we and others found that U1 snRNP/SR and RNAP II are among the main factors that associate with the protein fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) (19, 22–27). Understanding the normal roles of FUS and the pathways in which it functions are of great importance be-cause FUS is mutated to cause the fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (28–32). In vivo studies in-dicate that FUS plays numerous roles in the nucleus, including transcription, splicing, microRNA processing, and DNA repair (28–32). How FUS is involved in these processes and whether FUS is directly involved have not been established. Because robust in vitro systems for the coupled txn/splicing reaction are now routinely used (14, 15, 17, 19, 33), we can di-rectly test the roles of U1 snRNP and FUS in this coupled re-action. In recent work, an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO) that base-pairs to the 5′ end of U1 snRNA was used to functionally inactivate U1 snRNP (34, 35). Here, we report that this U1 AMO disrupts the association between U1 snRNP and both FUS and RNAP II, whereas FUS remains associated with RNAP II. However, in FUS knockdown (KD) nuclear extracts, we found that U1 snRNP can no longer interact with RNAP II. Furthermore, our data reveal that FUS must be present during transcription in order for splicing to take place in the coupled txn/splicing system. Together, our data indicate that FUS func-tions in coupling transcription to splicing via mediating an as-sociation between U1 snRNP and RNAP II.},

Moreover, recent reports have shown that the protein interacts with the 3'UTRs of specific mRNAs. The aberrant cellular distribution and aggregation of TDP-43 were recently reported in neurodegenerative diseases, namely frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A detailed description of the determinants for cellular localization has yet to emerge, including information on how the known functions of TDP-43 and cellular targeting affect each other. We provide the first experimental evidence that TDP-43 continuously shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription-dependent manner. Furthermore, we investigate the role of the functional TDP-43 domains in determining cellular targeting through a combination of immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation methods. Our analyses indicate that the C-terminus is essential for solubility and cellular localization, because its deletion results in the formation of large nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates. Disruption of the RNA-recognition domain required for RNA and DNA binding, however, alters nuclear distribution by decreasing TDP-43 presence in the nucleoplasm. Our findings suggest that TDP-43 solubility and localization are particularly sensitive to disruptions that extend beyond the newly found nuclear localization signal and depend on a combination of factors that are closely connected to the functional properties of this protein.},

Most FTDP-17 cases show neuronal and/or glial inclusions that stain positively with antibodies raised against the microtubule-associated protein Tau, although the Tau pathology varies considerably in both its quantity (or severity) and characteristics. Previous studies have mapped the FTDP-17 locus to a 2-centimorgan region on chromosome 17q21.11; the tau gene also lies within this region. We have now sequenced tau in FTDP-17 families and identified three missense mutations (G272V, P301L and R406W) and three mutations in the 5' splice site of exon 10. The splice-site mutations all destabilize a potential stem-loop structure which is probably involved in regulating the alternative splicing of exon10. This causes more frequent usage of the 5' splice site and an increased proportion of tau transcripts that include exon 10. The increase in exon 10+ messenger RNA will increase the proportion of Tau containing four microtubule-binding repeats, which is consistent with the neuropathology described in several families with FTDP-17.},

	abstract = {Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are essential for normal synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Indirect evidence has indicated that extensive alternative splicing of neurexin mRNAs may produce hundreds if not thousands of neurexin isoforms, but no direct evidence for such diversity has been available. Here we use unbiased long-read sequencing of full-length neurexin (Nrxn)1$\alpha$, Nrxn1$\beta$, Nrxn2$\beta$, Nrxn3$\alpha$, and Nrxn3$\beta$ mRNAs to systematically assess how many sites of alternative splicing are used in neurexins with a significant frequency, and whether alternative splicing events at these sites are independent of each other. In sequencing more than 25,000 full-length mRNAs, we identified a novel, abundantly used alternatively spliced exon of Nrxn1$\alpha$ and Nrxn3$\alpha$ (referred to as alternatively spliced sequence 6) that encodes a 9-residue insertion in the flexible hinge region between the fifth LNS (laminin-$\alpha$, neurexin, sex hormone-binding globulin) domain and the third EGF-like sequence. In addition, we observed several larger-scale events of alternative splicing that deleted multiple domains and were much less frequent than the canonical six sites of alternative splicing in neurexins. All of the six canonical events of alternative splicing appear to be independent of each other, suggesting that neurexins may exhibit an even larger isoform diversity than previously envisioned and comprise thousands of variants. Our data are consistent with the notion that $\alpha$-neurexins represent extracellular protein-interaction scaffolds in which different LNS and EGF domains mediate distinct interactions that affect diverse functions and are independently regulated by independent events of alternative splicing.},

abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of disorders clinically associated with behavioral and personality changes, language impairment and deficits in executive functioning and pathologically associated with degeneration of frontal and temporal lobes. Some patients present with motor symptoms including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetic research over the past two decades in FTLD families led to the identification of three common FTLD genes (microtubule associated protein tau, progranulin and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) and a small number of rare FTLD genes, explaining the disease in almost all autosomal dominant FTLD families but only a minority of apparently sporadic patients or patients in whom the family history is less clear. Identification of additional FTLD (risk) genes is therefore highly anticipated, especially with the emerging use of next-generation sequencing. Common variants in the transmembrane protein 106 B were identified as a genetic risk factor of FTLD and disease modifier in patients with known mutations. This review summarizes for each FTLD gene what we know about the type and frequency of mutations, their associated clinical and pathological features and potential disease mechanisms and we provide an overview of emerging disease pathways encompassing multiple FTLD genes. We further discuss how FTLD specific issues such as disease heterogeneity, the presence of an unclear family history and the possible role of an oligogenic basis of FTLD can pose challenges for future FTLD gene identification and risk assessment of specific variants. Finally, we highlight emerging clinical, genetic and translational research opportunities that lie ahead. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: We aimed to accurately estimate the frequency of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 that has been associated with a large proportion of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: We screened 4448 patients diagnosed with ALS (El Escorial criteria) and 1425 patients with FTD (Lund-Manchester criteria) from 17 regions worldwide for the GGGGCC hexanucleotide expansion using a repeat-primed PCR assay. We assessed familial disease status on the basis of self-reported family history of similar neurodegenerative diseases at the time of sample collection. We compared haplotype data for 262 patients carrying the expansion with the known Finnish founder risk haplotype across the chromosomal locus. We calculated age-related penetrance using the Kaplan-Meier method with data for 603 individuals with the expansion. Findings: In patients with sporadic ALS, we identified the repeat expansion in 236 (7??0{\%}) of 3377 white individuals from the USA, Europe, and Australia, two (4??1{\%}) of 49 black individuals from the USA, and six (8??3{\%}) of 72 Hispanic individuals from the USA. The mutation was present in 217 (39??3{\%}) of 552 white individuals with familial ALS from Europe and the USA. 59 (6??0{\%}) of 981 white Europeans with sporadic FTD had the mutation, as did 99 (24??8{\%}) of 400 white Europeans with familial FTD. Data for other ethnic groups were sparse, but we identified one Asian patient with familial ALS (from 20 assessed) and two with familial FTD (from three assessed) who carried the mutation. The mutation was not carried by the three Native Americans or 360 patients from Asia or the Pacific Islands with sporadic ALS who were tested, or by 41 Asian patients with sporadic FTD. All patients with the repeat expansion had (partly or fully) the founder haplotype, suggesting a one-off expansion occurring about 1500 years ago. The pathogenic expansion was non-penetrant in individuals younger than 35 years, 50{\%} penetrant by 58 years, and almost fully penetrant by 80 years. Interpretation: A common Mendelian genetic lesion in C9orf72 is implicated in many cases of sporadic and familial ALS and FTD. Testing for this pathogenic expansion should be considered in the management and genetic counselling of patients with these fatal neurodegenerative diseases.

Here we report an expansion of a non-coding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43 based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7{\%}) and familial ALS (22.5{\%}). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.},

Its cause is unknown and it is uniformly fatal, typically within five years. About 10{\%} of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance after the sixth decade. In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families.},

Abnormal filamentous tau deposits have been reported as a pathological characteristic in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia, Pick Disease, Alzheimer disease, argyrophilic grain disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In the last five years, extensive research has identified 34 different pathogenic MAPT mutations in 101 families worldwide. In vitro, cell-free and transfected cell studies have provided valuable information on tau dysfunction and transgenic mice carrying human MAPT mutations are being generated to study the influence of MAPT mutations in vivo. This mutation update describes the considerable differences in clinical and pathological presentation of patients with MAPT mutations and summarizes the effect of the different mutations on tau functioning.

The incidence was higher among men (3.0 per 100 000 person years; 95{\%} CI 2.8 to 3.3) than among women (2.4 per 100 000 person years; 95{\%} CI 2.2 to 2.6). Spinal onset ALS was more common among men compared with women, particularly in the 70-80 year age group. Disease occurrence decreased rapidly after 80 years of age.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ALS incidence is homogeneous across Europe. Sex differences in incidence may be explained by the higher incidence of spinal onset ALS among men, and the age related disease pattern suggests that ALS occurs within a susceptible group within the population rather than being a disease of ageing.},

However, little is known about the programs instructing specific branching patterns in vertebrate neurons and whether such programs influence dendritic spines and synapses. Using knockout and knockdown studies combined with morphological, molecular, and electrophysiological analysis, we show that the homeobox Cux1 and Cux2 are intrinsic and complementary regulators of dendrite branching, spine development, and synapse formation in layer II-III neurons of the cerebral cortex. Cux genes control the number and maturation of dendritic spines partly through direct regulation of the expression of Xlr3b and Xlr4b, chromatin remodeling genes previously implicated in cognitive defects. Accordingly, abnormal dendrites and synapses in Cux2-/-mice correlate with reduced synaptic function and defects in working memory. These demonstrate critical roles of Cux in dendritogenesis and highlight subclass-specific mechanisms of synapse regulation that contribute to the establishment of cognitive circuits. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the specific role of TLS has not been clarified. TLS-null neurons display abnormal spine morphology, suggesting that TLS-deficiency may impair activity-dependent actin reorganization in spines. To address this issue, we screened for mouse brain transcripts by their in vitro binding to TLS, and identified RNAs that associate with TLS, including mRNAs encoding actin-related proteins such as actin-stabilizing protein Nd1-L. Nd1-L transcripts were increased in the dendrites upon mGluR activation and significantly reduced in TLS-null dendrites. Overexpression of Nd1-L in mouse hippocampal neurons prevented damage to spine structure caused by actin destabilization. Our results demonstrate that TLS associates with mRNA encoding an actin-related protein and may be involved in actin reorganization in spines.},

Its expression is tightly autoregulated, with loss of this regulation implicated in human neuropathology. We demonstrate that TDP-43 overexpression in humans and mice activates a 3' untranslated region (UTR) intron, resulting in excision of the proximal polyA site (PAS) pA(1). This activates a cryptic PAS that prevents TDP-43 expression through a nuclear retention mechanism. Superimposed on this process, overexpression of TDP-43 blocks recognition of pA(1) by competing with CstF-64 for PAS binding. Overall, we uncover complex interplay between transcription, splicing, and 3' end processing to effect autoregulation of TDP-43.},

TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is homologous to the hetero-geneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are involved in RNA processing, and its abnormal cellular distribution is a key fea-ture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), two neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that TDP-43 facilitates the production of a subset of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by both interacting with the nuclear Drosha complex and binding directly to the relevant primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Furthermore, cytoplasmic TDP-43, which interacts with the Dicer complex, promotes the processing of some of these pre-miRNAs via binding to their terminal loops. Finally, we show that involvement of TDP-43 in miRNA biogenesis is indispensable for neuronal outgrowth. These results support a previously uncharac-terized role for TDP-43 in posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA expression in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.},

Mutations in TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43, cause some cases of ALS. The normal function of TDP-43 remains incompletely understood. To better understand TDP-43 biology, we generated mutant mice carrying a genetrap disruption of Tardbp. Mice homozygous for loss of TDP-43 are not viable. TDP-43 deficient embryos die about day 7.5 of embryonic development thereby demonstrating that TDP-43 protein is essential for normal prenatal development and survival. However, heterozygous Tardbp mutant mice exhibit signs of motor disturbance and muscle weakness. Compared with wild type control littermates, Tardbp (+/-) animals have significantly decreased forelimb grip strength and display deficits in a standard inverted grid test despite no evidence of pathologic changes in motor neurons. Thus, TDP-43 is essential for viability, and mild reduction in TDP-43 function is sufficient to cause motor deficits without degeneration of motor neurons.},

	abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) greatly diversifies metazoan transcriptomes and proteomes and is crucial for gene regulation. Current computational analysis methods of AS from Illumina RNA-sequencing data rely on preannotated libraries of known spliced transcripts, which hinders AS analysis with poorly annotated genomes and can further mask unknown AS patterns. To address this critical bioinformatics problem, we developed a method called the junction usage model (JUM) that uses a bottom-up approach to identify, analyze, and quantitate global AS profiles without any prior transcriptome annotations. JUM accurately reports global AS changes in terms of the five conventional AS patterns and an additional "composite" category composed of inseparable combinations of conventional patterns. JUM stringently classifies the difficult and disease-relevant pattern of intron retention (IR), reducing the false positive rate of IR detection commonly seen in other annotation-based methods to near-negligible rates. When analyzing AS in RNA samples derived from Drosophila heads, human tumors, and human cell lines bearing cancer-associated splicing factor mutations, JUM consistently identified approximately twice the number of novel AS events missed by other methods. Computational simulations showed JUM exhibits a 1.2 to 4.8 times higher true positive rate at a fixed cutoff of 5{\%} false discovery rate. In summary, JUM provides a framework and improved method that removes the necessity for transcriptome annotations and enables the detection, analysis, and quantification of AS patterns in complex metazoan transcriptomes with superior accuracy.},

Cytoplasmic inclusions of fused in sarcoma (FUS) are the hallmark of several forms of FTLD and ALS patients with mutations in the FUS gene. FUS is a multifunctional, predominantly nuclear, DNA and RNA binding protein. Here, we report that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type human FUS develop an aggressive phenotype with an early onset tremor followed by progressive hind limb paralysis and death by 12 weeks in homozygous animals. Large motor neurons were lost from the spinal cord accompanied by neurophysiological evidence of denervation and focal muscle atrophy. Surviving motor neurons in the spinal cord had greatly increased cytoplasmic expression of FUS, with globular and skein-like FUS-positive and ubiquitin-negative inclusions associated with astroglial and microglial reactivity. Cytoplasmic FUS inclusions were also detected in the brain of transgenic mice without apparent neuronal loss and little astroglial or microglial activation. Hemizygous FUS overexpressing mice showed no evidence of a motor phenotype or pathology. These findings recapitulate several pathological features seen in human ALS and FTLD patients, and suggest that overexpression of wild-type FUS in vulnerable neurons may be one of the root causes of disease. Furthermore, these mice will provide a new model to study disease mechanism, and test therapies.},

However, the underlying molecular and cellular defects remain unclear. Here we provide evidence for mitochondrial localization of FUS and its induction of mitochondrial damage. Remarkably, FTLD-FUS brain samples show increased FUS expression and mitochondrial defects. Biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that FUS interacts with a mitochondrial chaperonin, HSP60, and that FUS translocation to mitochondria is, at least in part, mediated by HSP60. Down-regulating HSP60 reduces mitochondrially localized FUS and partially rescues mitochondrial defects and neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by FUS expression in transgenic flies. This is the first report of direct mitochondrial targeting by a nuclear protein associated with neurodegeneration, suggesting that mitochondrial impairment may represent a critical event in different forms of FUS-proteinopathies and a common pathological feature for both ALS-FUS and FTLD-FUS. Our study offers a potential explanation for the highly heterogeneous nature and complex genetic presentation of different forms of FUS-proteinopathies.

Given the structural and functional similarities between the three genes, we screened TAF15 and EWS in 263 and 94 index FALS cases, respectively. No coding variants were found in EWS, while we identified six novel changes in TAF15. Of these, two 24 bp deletions and a R388H missense variant were also found in healthy controls. A D386N substitution was shown not to segregate with the disease in the affected pedigree. A single A31T and two R395Q changes were identified in FALS cases but not in over 1,100 controls. Interestingly, one of the R395Q FALS cases also harbors a TARDBP mutation (G384R).

In this study, we observe that brain and other tissue-regulated exons are significantly enriched in flexible regions of proteins that likely form conserved interaction surfaces. These proteins participate in significantly more interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks than other proteins. Using LUMIER, an automated PPI assay, we observe that approximately one-third of analyzed neural-regulated exons affect PPIs. Inclusion of these exons stimulated and repressed different partner interactions at comparable frequencies. This assay further revealed functions of individual exons, including a role for a neural-specific exon in promoting an interaction between Bridging Integrator 1 (Bin1)/Amphiphysin II and Dynamin 2 (Dnm2) that facilitates endocytosis. Collectively, our results provide evidence that regulated alternative exons frequently remodel interactions to establish tissue-dependent PPI networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Long mammalian introns make it challenging for the RNA processing machinery to identify exons accurately. We find that LINE-derived sequences (LINEs) contribute to this selection by recruiting dozens of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to introns. This includes MATR3, which promotes binding of PTBP1 to multivalent binding sites within LINEs. Both RBPs repress splicing and 3′ end processing within and around LINEs. Notably, repressive RBPs preferentially bind to evolutionarily young LINEs, which are located far from exons. These RBPs insulate the LINEs and the surrounding intronic regions from RNA processing. Upon evolutionary divergence, changes in RNA motifs within LINEs lead to gradual loss of their insulation. Hence, older LINEs are located closer to exons, are a common source of tissue-specific exons, and increasingly bind to RBPs that enhance RNA processing. Thus, LINEs are hubs for the assembly of repressive RBPs and also contribute to the evolution of new, lineage-specific transcripts in mammals.

	abstract = {Cytosolic accumulation of TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major neuropathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, the mechanisms involved in TDP-43 accumulation remain largely unknown. Previously, we reported that inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) prevented cytosolic stress granule accumulation of TDP-43, correlating with depletion of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K from stress granules. In the present study, we further investigated the relationship between TDP-43 and hnRNP K and their control by CDKs. Inhibition of CDK2 abrogated the accumulation of TDP-43 into stress granules. Phosphorylated CDK2 co-localized with accumulated TDP-43 and phosphorylated hnRNP K in stress granules. Inhibition of CDK2 phosphorylation blocked phosphorylation of hnRNP K, preventing its incorporation into stress granules. Due to interaction between hnRNP K with TDP-43, the loss of hnRNP K from stress granules prevented accumulation of TDP-43. Mutation of Ser216 and Ser284 phosphorylation sites on hnRNP K inhibited hnRNP K- and TDP-43-positive stress granule formation in transfected cells. The interaction between hnRNP K and TDP-43 was further confirmed by the loss of TDP-43 accumulation following siRNA-mediated inhibition of hnRNP K expression. A substantial decrease of CDK2 and hnRNP K expression in spinal cord motor neurons in ALS patients demonstrates a potential key role for these proteins in ALS and TDP-43 accumulation, indicating that further investigation of the association between hnRNP K and TDP-43 is warranted. Understanding how kinase activity modulates TDP-43 accumulation may provide new pharmacological targets for disease intervention.},

Here we studied a novel ALS/FTD family and identified the P362L mutation in the low-complexity domain (LCD) of T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1). Subsequent genetic association analyses showed an increased burden of TIA1 LCD mutations in ALS patients compared to controls (p = 8.7 × 10−6). Postmortem neuropathology of five TIA1 mutations carriers showed a consistent pathological signature with numerous round, hyaline, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions. TIA1 mutations significantly increased the propensity of TIA1 protein to undergo phase transition. In live cells, TIA1 mutations delayed stress granule (SG) disassembly and promoted the accumulation of non-dynamic SGs that harbored TDP-43. Moreover, TDP-43 in SGs became less mobile and insoluble. The identification of TIA1 mutations in ALS/FTD reinforces the importance of RNA metabolism and SG dynamics in ALS/FTD pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of the DNA/RNA binding protein fused in sarcoma as cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons and glial cells is the pathological hallmark of all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutations in FUS as well as in several subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which are not associated with FUS mutations. The mechanisms leading to inclusion formation and fused in sarcoma-associated neurodegeneration are only poorly understood. Because fused in sarcoma belongs to a family of proteins known as FET, which also includes Ewing's sarcoma and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15, we investigated the potential involvement of these other FET protein family members in the pathogenesis of fused in sarcoma proteinopathies. Immunohistochemical analysis of FET proteins revealed a striking difference among the various conditions, with pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with FUS mutations being labelled exclusively for fused in sarcoma, whereas fused in sarcoma-positive inclusions in subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration also consistently immunostained for TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 and variably for Ewing's sarcoma. Immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted from post-mortem tissue of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with fused in sarcoma pathology demonstrated a relative shift of all FET proteins towards insoluble protein fractions, while genetic analysis of the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 and Ewing's sarcoma gene did not identify any pathogenic variants. Cell culture experiments replicated the findings of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with FUS mutations by confirming the absence of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 and Ewing's sarcoma alterations upon expression of mutant fused in sarcoma. In contrast, all endogenous FET proteins were recruited into cytoplasmic stress granules upon general inhibition of Transportin-mediated nuclear import, mimicking the findings in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with fused in sarcoma pathology. These results allow a separation of fused in sarcoma proteinopathies caused by FUS mutations from those without a known genetic cause based on neuropathological features. More importantly, our data imply different pathological processes underlying inclusion formation and cell death between both conditions; the pathogenesis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with FUS mutations appears to be more restricted to dysfunction of fused in sarcoma, while a more global and complex dysregulation of all FET proteins is involved in the subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with fused in sarcoma pathology.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, that harbor prion-like domains, cause some forms of ALS. There are at least 213 human proteins harboring RNA recognition motifs, including FUS and TDP-43, raising the possibility that additional RNA-binding proteins might contribute to ALS pathogenesis. We performed a systematic survey of these proteins to find additional candidates similar to TDP-43 and FUS, followed by bioinformatics to predict prion-like domains in a subset of them. We sequenced one of these genes, TAF15, in patients with ALS and identified missense variants, which were absent in a large number of healthy controls. These disease-associated variants of TAF15 caused formation of cytoplasmic foci when expressed in primary cultures of spinal cord neurons. Very similar to TDP-43 and FUS, TAF15 aggregated in vitro and conferred neurodegeneration in Drosophila, with the ALS-linked variants having a more severe effect than wild type. Immunohistochemistry of postmortem spinal cord tissue revealed mislocalization of TAF15 in motor neurons of patients with ALS. We propose that aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins might contribute very broadly to ALS pathogenesis and the genes identified in our yeast functional screen, coupled with prion-like domain prediction analysis, now provide a powerful resource to facilitate ALS disease gene discovery.},

Mutations in related RNA-binding proteins TDP-43, FUS/TLS and TAF15 have been connected to ALS. These three proteins share several features, including the presence of a bioinformatics-predicted prion domain, aggregation-prone nature in vitro and in vivo and toxic effects when expressed in multiple model systems. Given these commonalities, we hypothesized that a related protein, EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1), might also exhibit similar properties and therefore could contribute to disease. Here, we report an analysis of EWSR1 in multiple functional assays, including mutational screening in ALS patients and controls. We identified three missense variants in EWSR1 in ALS patients, which were absent in a large number of healthy control individuals. We show that disease-specific variants affect EWSR1 localization in motor neurons. We also provide multiple independent lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence that EWSR1 has similar properties as TDP-43, FUS and TAF15, including aggregation-prone behavior in vitro and ability to confer neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Postmortem analysis of sporadic ALS cases also revealed cytoplasmic mislocalization of EWSR1. Together, our studies highlight a potential role for EWSR1 in ALS, provide a collection of functional assays to be used to assess roles of additional RNA-binding proteins in disease and support an emerging concept that a class of aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins might contribute broadly to ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases.},

The resulting fusion gene products have attracted considerable interest as diagnostic and promising therapeutic targets. So far, oncogenic FET fusion proteins have been regarded as strong transcription factors that aberrantly activate or repress target genes of their DNA-binding fusion partners. However, the role of the transactivating domain in the context of the normal FET proteins is poorly defined, and, therefore, our knowledge on how FET aberrations impact on tumor biology is incomplete. Since we believe that a full understanding of aberrant FET protein function can only arise from looking at both sides of the coin, the good and the evil, this paper summarizes evidence for the central function of FET proteins in bridging RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair.},

To better understand FUS function in vivo, we examined the consequences of disrupting Fus in mice. Our results indicate that Fus is essential for viability of neonatal animals, influences lymphocyte development in a non-cell-intrinsic manner, has an intrinsic role in the proliferative responses of B cells to specific mitogenic stimuli and is required for the maintenance of genomic stability.

Expression of R495X FUS, which abrogates a putative nuclear localization signal at the C-terminus of FUS, in HEK-293 cells and in the zebrafish spinal cord caused a striking cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein to a greater extent than that observed for recessive (H517Q) and dominant (R521G) missense mutants. Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels.

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an uncommon neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Several genes, including SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, Ubiquilin 2, C9orf72 and Profilin 1, have been linked with the sporadic and familiar forms of ALS. FUS is a DNA/RNA-binding protein (RBP) that forms cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS and frontotemporal lobular degeneration (FTLD) patients' brains and spinal cords. However, it is unknown whether the RNA-binding ability of FUS is required for causing ALS pathogenesis. Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs). To determine the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in ALS, we mutated FUS RNA-binding sites (F305L, F341L, F359L, F368L) and generated RNA-binding-incompetent FUS mutants with and without ALS-causing mutations (R518K or R521C). We found that mutating the aforementioned four phenylalanine (F) amino acids to leucines (L) (4F-L) eliminates FUS RNA binding. We observed that these RNA-binding mutations block neurodegenerative phenotypes seen in the fly brains, eyes and motor neurons compared with the expression of RNA-binding-competent FUS carrying ALS-causing mutations. Interestingly, RNA-binding-deficient FUS strongly localized to the nucleus of Drosophila motor neurons and mammalian neuronal cells, whereas FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations was distributed to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Importantly, we determined that incorporation of mutant FUS into the SG compartment is dependent on the RNA-binding ability of FUS. In summary, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding ability of FUS is essential for the neurodegenerative phenotype in vivo of mutant FUS (either through direct contact with RNA or through interactions with other RBPs).},

	abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can reveal new genes and splice variants and quantify expression genome-wide in a single assay. The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TEs) have significantly influenced the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks in the human genome. Post-transcriptional regulation of human genes by TE-derived sequences has been observed in specific contexts, but has yet to be systematically and comprehensively investigated. Here, we study a collection of 75 CLIP-Seq experiments mapping the RNA binding sites for a diverse set of 51 human proteins to explore the role of TEs in post-transcriptional regulation of human mRNAs and lncRNAs via RNA-protein interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We detect widespread interactions between RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and many families of TE-derived sequence in the CLIP-Seq data. Further, alignment coverage peaks on specific positions of the TE consensus sequences, illuminating a diversity of TE-specific RBP binding motifs. Evidence of binding and conservation of these motifs in the nonrepetitive transcriptome suggests that TEs have generally appropriated existing sequence preferences of the RBPs. Depletion assays for numerous RBPs show that TE-derived binding sites affect transcript abundance and splicing similarly to nonrepetitive sites. However, in a few cases the effect of RBP binding depends on the specific TE family bound; for example, the ubiquitously expressed RBP HuR confers transcript stability unless bound to an Alu element.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests a widespread role for TEs in shaping RNA-protein regulatory networks in the human genome.},

	abstract = {The regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression in prostate cancer is still poorly understood. The activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in prostate cancer cells was previously shown to lower AR expression by a rapamycin-sensitive, posttranscriptional mechanism involving the AR mRNA 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). In a search for an intermediate within the EGFR/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that regulates AR at this site, we identified the nucleic acid-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K), by mass spectrometric analysis of Akt immune complexes from lipid raft-enriched subcellular fractions. We show here that hnRNP-K is a novel inhibitor of AR mRNA translation that regulates androgen-responsive gene expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation. A functional hnRNP-K binding site involved in down-regulating AR protein levels was identified in the AR mRNA 5'-UTR. Further analysis revealed that hnRNP-K is also able to inhibit AR translation in the absence of the 5'-UTR, consistent with the presence of additional predicted hnRNP-K binding sites within the AR open reading frame and in the 3'-UTR. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human prostate cancer tissue microarray revealed an inverse correlation between hnRNP-K expression and AR protein levels in organ-confined prostate tumors and a substantial decline in cytoplasmic hnRNP-K in metastases, despite an overall increase in hnRNP-K levels in metastatic tumors. These data suggest that translational inhibition of AR by hnRNP-K may occur in organ-confined tumors but possibly at a reduced level in metastases. HnRNP-K is the first protein identified that directly interacts with and regulates the AR translational apparatus.},

@article{Gal-Mark2009,
	abstract = {More than 5{\%} of alternatively spliced internal exons in the human genome are derived from Alu elements in a process termed exonization. Alus are comprised of two homologous arms separated by an internal polypyrimidine tract (PPT). In most exonizations, splice sites are selected from within the same arm. We hypothesized that the internal PPT may prevent selection of a splice site further downstream. Here, we demonstrate that this PPT enhanced the selection of an upstream 5' splice site (5'ss), even in the presence of a stronger 5'ss downstream. Deletion of this PPT shifted selection to the stronger downstream 5'ss. This enhancing effect depended on the strength of the downstream 5'ss, on the efficiency of base-pairing to U1 snRNA, and on the length of the PPT. This effect of the PPT was mediated by the binding of TIA proteins and was dependent on the distance between the PPT and the upstream 5'ss. A wide-scale evolutionary analysis of introns across 22 eukaryotes revealed an enrichment in PPTs within approximately 20 nt downstream of the 5'ss. For most metazoans, the strength of the 5'ss inversely correlated with the presence of a downstream PPT, indicative of the functional role of the PPT. Finally, we found that the proteins that mediate this effect, TIA and U1C, and in particular their functional domains, are highly conserved across evolution. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of the role of TIA1/TIAR proteins in enhancing recognition of exons, in general, and Alu exons, in particular.},

	abstract = {TDP-43 is a critical RNA-binding factor associated with pre-mRNA splicing in mammals. Its expression is tightly autoregulated, with loss of this regulation implicated in human neuropathology. We demonstrate that TDP-43 overexpression in humans and mice activates a 3' untranslated region (UTR) intron, resulting in excision of the proximal polyA site (PAS) pA(1). This activates a cryptic PAS that prevents TDP-43 expression through a nuclear retention mechanism. Superimposed on this process, overexpression of TDP-43 blocks recognition of pA(1) by competing with CstF-64 for PAS binding. Overall, we uncover complex interplay between transcription, splicing, and 3' end processing to effect autoregulation of TDP-43.},

	abstract = {The RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 and FUS form abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates in affected tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia. TDP-43 and FUS localize mainly in the nucleus where they regulate pre-mRNA splicing, but they are also involved in mRNA transport, stability, and translation. To better investigate their cytoplasmic activities, we applied an RNA immunoprecipitation and chip analysis to define the mRNAs associated to TDP-43 and FUS in the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes from motoneuronal NSC-34 cells. We found that they bind different sets of mRNAs although converging on common cellular pathways. Bioinformatics analyses identified the (UG)(n) consensus motif in 80{\%} of 3'-UTR sequences of TDP-43 targets, whereas for FUS the binding motif was less evident. By in vitro assays we validated binding to selected target 3'-UTRs, including Vegfa and Grn for TDP-43, and Vps54, Nvl, and Taf15 for FUS. We showed that TDP-43 has a destabilizing activity on Vegfa and Grn mRNAs and may ultimately affect progranulin protein content, whereas FUS does not affect mRNA stability/translation of its targets. We also demonstrated that three different point mutations in TDP-43 did not change the binding affinity for Vegfa and Grn mRNAs or their protein level. Our data indicate that TDP-43 and FUS recognize distinct sets of mRNAs and differently regulate their fate in the cytoplasm of motoneuron-like cells, therefore suggesting complementary roles in neuronal RNA metabolism and neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequential assembly of the human spliceosome on RNA transcripts regulates splicing across the human transcriptome. The core spliceosome component PRPF8 is essential for spliceosome assembly through its participation in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for splice-site recognition, branch-point formation and catalysis. PRPF8 deficiency is linked to human diseases like retinitis pigmentosa or myeloid neoplasia, but its genome-wide effects on constitutive and alternative splicing remain unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we show that alterations in RNA splicing patterns across the human transcriptome that occur in conditions of restricted cellular PRPF8 abundance are defined by the altered splicing of introns with weak 5' splice sites. iCLIP of spliceosome components reveals that PRPF8 depletion decreases RNP complex formation at most splice sites in exon-intron junctions throughout the genome. However, impaired splicing affects only a subset of human transcripts, enriched for mitotic cell cycle factors, leading to mitotic arrest. Preferentially retained introns and differentially used exons in the affected genes contain weak 5' splice sites, but are otherwise indistinguishable from adjacent spliced introns. Experimental enhancement of splice-site strength in mini-gene constructs overcomes the effects of PRPF8 depletion on the kinetics and fidelity of splicing during transcription.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Competition for PRPF8 availability alters the transcription-coupled splicing of RNAs in which weak 5' splice sites predominate, enabling diversification of human gene expression during biological processes like mitosis. Our findings exemplify the regulatory potential of changes in the core spliceosome machinery, which may be relevant to slow-onset human genetic diseases linked to PRPF8 deficiency.},

It is required for the final maturation of most human pre-mRNAs and is therefore important to understand. We have used several strategies to block splicing at specific stages in vivo and studied their effect on 3' end formation. We demonstrate that a terminal splice acceptor site is essential to establish coupling with the poly(A) signal in a chromosomally integrated $\beta$-globin gene. This is in part to alleviate the suppression of 3' end formation by U1 small nuclear RNA, which is known to bind pre-mRNA at the earliest stage of spliceosome assembly. Interestingly, blocks to splicing that are subsequent to terminal splice acceptor site function, but before catalysis, have little observable effect on 3' end formation. These data suggest that early stages of spliceosome assembly are sufficient to functionally couple splicing and 3' end formation, but that on-going intron removal is less critical.},

	abstract = {Mutations in TARDBP, encoding Tar DNA binding protein-43 (TDP43), cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Attempts to model TDP43 dysfunction in mice have used knockouts or transgenic overexpressors, which have revealed the difficulties of manipulating TDP43, whose level is tightly controlled by auto-regulation. In a complementary approach, to create useful mouse models for the dissection of TDP43 function and pathology, we have identified a nonsense mutation in the endogenous mouse Tardbp gene through screening an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutant mouse archive. The mutation is predicted to cause a Q101X truncation in TDP43. We have characterised Tardbp(Q101X) mice to investigate this mutation in perturbing TDP43 biology at endogenous expression levels. We found the Tardbp(Q101X) mutation is homozygous embryonic lethal, highlighting the importance of TDP43 in early development. Heterozygotes (Tardbp(+/Q101X) ) have abnormal levels of mutant transcript, but we find no evidence of the truncated protein and mice have similar full-length TDP43 protein levels as wildtype littermates. Nevertheless, Tardbp(+/Q101X) mice have abnormal alternative splicing of downstream gene targets, and limb-clasp and body tone phenotypes. Thus the nonsense mutation in Tardbp causes a mild loss-of-function phenotype and behavioural assessment suggests underlying neurological abnormalities. Due to the role of TDP43 in ALS, we investigated potential interactions with another known causative gene, mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Tardbp(+/Q101X) mice were crossed with the SOD1(G93Adl) transgenic mouse model of ALS. Behavioural and physiological assessment did not reveal modifying effects on the progression of ALS-like symptoms in the double mutant progeny from this cross. In summary, the Tardbp(Q101X) mutant mice are a useful tool for the dissection of TDP43 protein regulation, effects on splicing, embryonic development and neuromuscular phenotypes.

Cluster analysis revealed hundreds of developmentally-dynamic introns that exhibit increased IR in mature erythroblasts, and are enriched in functions related to RNA processing such as SF3B1 spliceosomal factor. Distinct, developmentally-stable IR clusters are enriched in metal-ion binding functions and include mitoferrin genes SLC25A37 and SLC25A28 that are critical for iron homeostasis. Some IR transcripts are abundant, e.g. comprising ∼50{\%} of highly-expressed SLC25A37 and SF3B1 transcripts in late erythroblasts, and thereby limiting functional mRNA levels. IR transcripts tested were predominantly nuclear-localized. Splice site strength correlated with IR among stable but not dynamic intron clusters, indicating distinct regulation of dynamically-increased IR in late erythroblasts. Retained introns were preferentially associated with alternative exons with premature termination codons (PTCs). High IR was observed in disease-causing genes including SF3B1 and the RNA binding protein FUS. Comparative studies demonstrated that the intron retention program in erythroblasts shares features with other tissues but ultimately is unique to erythropoiesis. We conclude that IR is a multi-dimensional set of processes that post-transcriptionally regulate diverse gene groups during normal erythropoiesis, misregulation of which could be responsible for human disease.},

Our bioinformatic analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic data of normal white blood cell differentiation reveal IR as a physiological mechanism of gene expression control. IR regulates the expression of 86 functionally related genes, including those that determine the nuclear shape that is unique to granulocytes. Retention of introns in specific genes is associated with downregulation of splicing factors and higher GC content. IR, conserved between human and mouse, led to reduced mRNA and protein levels by triggering the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. In contrast to the prevalent view that NMD is limited to mRNAs encoding aberrant proteins, our data establish that IR coupled with NMD is a conserved mechanism in normal granulopoiesis. Physiological IR may provide an energetically favorable level of dynamic gene expression control prior to sustained gene translation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Matera2014,
	abstract = {One of the most amazing findings in molecular biology was the discovery that eukaryotic genes are discontinuous, with coding DNA being interrupted by stretches of non-coding sequence. The subsequent realization that the intervening regions are removed from pre-mRNA transcripts via the activity of a common set of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), which assemble together with associated proteins into a complex known as the spliceosome, was equally surprising. How do cells coordinate the assembly of this molecular machine? And how does the spliceosome accurately recognize exons and introns to carry out the splicing reaction? Insights into these questions have been gained by studying the life cycle of spliceosomal snRNAs from their transcription, nuclear export and re-import to their dynamic assembly into the spliceosome. This assembly process can also affect the regulation of alternative splicing and has implications for human disease.},

	abstract = {More than half of all human genes produce prematurely terminated polyadenylated short mRNAs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. CLIP-seq (cross-linking immunoprecipitation [CLIP] combined with deep sequencing) of FUS (fused in sarcoma) in neuronal cells showed that FUS is frequently clustered around an alternative polyadenylation (APA) site of nascent RNA. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) demonstrated that FUS stalls RNAP II and prematurely terminates transcription. When an APA site is located upstream of an FUS cluster, FUS enhances polyadenylation by recruiting CPSF160 and up-regulates the alternative short transcript. In contrast, when an APA site is located downstream from an FUS cluster, polyadenylation is not activated, and the RNAP II-suppressing effect of FUS leads to down-regulation of the alternative short transcript. CAGE-seq (cap analysis of gene expression [CAGE] combined with deep sequencing) and PolyA-seq (a strand-specific and quantitative method for high-throughput sequencing of 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts) revealed that position-specific regulation of mRNA lengths by FUS is operational in two-thirds of transcripts in neuronal cells, with enrichment in genes involved in synaptic activities.},

	abstract = {Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Classical splicing mutations (type I) delete entire exons during pre-mRNA splicing. In this report, we describe nine examples of nonclassical splicing mutations in 12 A-T patients and compare cDNA changes to estimates of splice junction strengths based on maximum entropy modeling. These mutations fall into three categories: pseudoexon insertions (type II), single nucleotide changes within the exon (type III), and intronic changes that disrupt the conserved 3' splice sequence and lead to partial exon deletion (type IV). Four patients with a previously reported type II (pseudoexon) mutation all shared a common founder haplotype. Three patients with apparent missense or silent mutations actually had type III aberrant splicing and partial deletion of an exon. Five patients had type IV mutations that could have been misinterpreted as classical splicing mutations. Instead, their mutations disrupt a splice site and use another AG splice site located nearby within the exon; they lead to partial deletions at the beginning of exons. These nonclassical splicing mutations create frameshifts that result in premature termination codons. Without screening cDNA or using accurate models of splice site strength, the consequences of these genomic mutations cannot be reliably predicted. This may lead to further misinterpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations and may subsequently impact upon gene-based therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases that show considerable clinical and pathologic overlap, with no effective treatments available. Mutations in the RNA binding protein TDP-43 were recently identified in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and TDP-43 aggregates are found in both ALS and FTLD-U (FTLD with ubiquitin aggregates), suggesting a common underlying mechanism. We report that mice expressing a mutant form of human TDP-43 develop a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease reminiscent of both ALS and FTLD-U. Despite universal transgene expression throughout the nervous system, pathologic aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins accumulate only in specific neuronal populations, including layer 5 pyramidal neurons in frontal cortex, as well as spinal motor neurons, recapitulating the phenomenon of selective vulnerability seen in patients with FTLD-U and ALS. Surprisingly, cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates are not present, and hence are not required for TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration. These results indicate that the cellular and molecular substrates for selective vulnerability in FTLD-U and ALS are shared between mice and humans, and suggest that altered DNA/RNA-binding protein function, rather than toxic aggregation, is central to TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.},

@article{Lareau2007,
	abstract = {The human and mouse genomes share a number of long, perfectly conserved nucleotide sequences, termed ultraconserved elements. Whereas these regions can act as transcriptional enhancers when upstream of genes, those within genes are less well understood. In particular, the function of ultraconserved elements that overlap alternatively spliced exons of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins is unknown. Here we report that in every member of the human SR family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons' containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the 3' untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target the resulting messenger RNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologues of the human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three SR proteins have been previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and one of these is known to autoregulate its expression by coupling alternative splicing with decay; our results suggest that unproductive splicing is important for regulation of the entire SR family. We find that unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors may readily acquire this form of regulation.},

	abstract = {Growth and differentiation of the neurites depends on long-distance transport of a specific set of mRNAs to restricted area and their local translation. Here, we found that a TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa in size (TDP-43) plays an essential role in intracellular transport of mRNA. For identification of target RNAs recognized by TDP-43, we purified TDP-43 in soluble dimer form and subjected to in vitro systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) screening. All the TDP-43-bound RNAs were found to contain G-quadruplex (G4). Using a double-fluorescent probe system, G4-containing RNAs were found to be transported, together with TDP-43, into the distal neurites. Two lines of evidence indicated that loss of function of TDP-43 results in the neurodegenerative disorder: (i) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutant TDP-43M337V lacks the activity of binding and transport of G4-containing mRNAs; and (ii) RNA containing G4-forming GGGGCC repeat expansion from the ALS-linked C9orf72 gene absorbs TDP-43, thereby reducing the intracellular pool of functional TDP-43. Taken together, we propose that TDP-43 within neurons plays an essential role of mRNA transport into distal neurites for local translation, and thus, dysfunctions of TDP-43 cause neural diseases such as ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.},

	abstract = {Transactivating response region DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is the major protein component of ubiquitinated inclusions found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitinated inclusions. Two ALS-causing mutants (TDP-43(Q331K) and TDP-43(M337V)), but not wild-type human TDP-43, are shown here to provoke age-dependent, mutant-dependent, progressive motor axon degeneration and motor neuron death when expressed in mice at levels and in a cell type-selective pattern similar to endogenous TDP-43. Mutant TDP-43-dependent degeneration of lower motor neurons occurs without: (i) loss of TDP-43 from the corresponding nuclei, (ii) accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates, and (iii) accumulation of insoluble TDP-43. Computational analysis using splicing-sensitive microarrays demonstrates alterations of endogenous TDP-43-dependent alternative splicing events conferred by both human wild-type and mutant TDP-43(Q331K), but with high levels of mutant TDP-43 preferentially enhancing exon exclusion of some target pre-mRNAs affecting genes involved in neurological transmission and function. Comparison with splicing alterations following TDP-43 depletion demonstrates that TDP-43(Q331K) enhances normal TDP-43 splicing function for some RNA targets but loss-of-function for others. Thus, adult-onset motor neuron disease does not require aggregation or loss of nuclear TDP-43, with ALS-linked mutants producing loss and gain of splicing function of selected RNA targets at an early disease stage.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Proactive quality control is of critical importance as unanticipated biases, artifacts, or errors can potentially drive false associations and lead to flawed results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have developed the Quality of RNA-Seq Toolset, or QoRTs, a comprehensive, multifunction toolset that assists in quality control and data processing of high-throughput RNA sequencing data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: QoRTs generates an unmatched variety of quality control metrics, and can provide cross-comparisons of replicates contrasted by batch, biological sample, or experimental condition, revealing any outliers and/or systematic issues that could drive false associations or otherwise compromise downstream analyses. In addition, QoRTs simultaneously replaces the functionality of numerous other data-processing tools, and can quickly and efficiently generate quality control metrics, coverage counts (for genes, exons, and known/novel splice-junctions), and browser tracks. These functions can all be carried out as part of a single unified data-processing/quality control run, greatly reducing both the complexity and the total runtime of the analysis pipeline.

	abstract = {Complete or partial monosomy with respect to the X chromosome is the genetic basis of Turner syndrome in human females. Individuals with Turner syndrome have a spectrum of anatomical, physiological and behavioral phenotypes with expressivity dependent on the extent of monosomy and the parental origin of the single X 1 . Parent-of-origin influences on social cognition in Turner syndrome might be due to the presence of imprinted genes on the X 2 . Imprinting of X-linked genes has also been implicated in the male prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders 3 , in male sexual orientation 4,5 and in the developmental delay of XO mouse embryos 6–8 . The only molecular evidence for X-chromosome imprinting, however, concerns X-chromosome inactivation in specific circumstances 9,10 and does not account for these phenotypes. Using a mouse model for Turner syndrome, we searched for locus-specific imprinting of X-linked genes in developing brain. We identified a cluster of X-linked genes containing at least three genes that show transcriptional repression of paternal alleles. Imprinting of these three genes, Xlr3b, Xlr4b and Xlr4c, is independent of X-chromosome inactivation and has a dynamic and complex pattern of tissue and stage specificity. Virtually all of the more than 70 imprinted genes thus far identified in mammals, with one notable exception, are autosomally linked 11 . The exception is Xist, the key effector of X-chromosome dosage compen-sation in mammals. In mice, maternal X-specific expression of Tsix, the antisense form of Xist, in trophectodermal tissues impels paternal X-specific expression of Xist, inactivating the paternal X chromo-some 12 . Thus, X-linked genes that are active in mouse trophectoderm and subject to X inactivation, Esx1 for instance 13 , have maternal-specific expression, but these genes are not imprinted per se. Inactiva-tion of genes on the paternal X in marsupials also seems to be a chromosomal effect and not locus-specific 14 . Locus-specific imprint-ing of X-linked genes, apart from Xist, has not previously been shown in mammals to our knowledge. Because imprinting is manifested most plainly at the level of transcription, we used comparative transcrip-tome analysis to identify X-linked imprinted genes in a mouse model for Turner syndrome. In consideration of Turner syndrome–associated cognitive impairment in human females, we compared transcriptomes from neonatal brain from karyotypically normal mice (40,XX and 40,XY) and Turner syndrome–like mice (39,X m and 39,X p). Two mutant strains of Mus musculus domesticus produce X-mono-somic females at high frequencies. One strain, Patchy fur, carries an inversion on the X chromosome spanning the pseudoautosomal Xlr3b},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the genetics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have provided key mechanistic insights to the pathogenesis of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. Among many etiologies for ALS, the identification of mutations and proteinopathies in two RNA binding proteins, TDP-43 (TARDBP or TAR DNA binding protein 43) and its closely related RNA/DNA binding protein FUS (fused in sarcoma), raises the intriguing possibility that perturbations to the RNA homeostasis and metabolism in neurons may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Although the similarities between TDP-43 and FUS suggest that mutations and proteinopathy involving these two proteins may converge on the same mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration, there is increasing evidence that FUS mutations target distinct mechanisms to cause early disease onset and aggressive progression of disease. This review focuses on the recent advances on the molecular, cellular and genetic approaches to uncover the mechanisms of wild type and mutant FUS proteins during development and in neurodegeneration. These findings provide important insights to understand how FUS mutations may perturb the maintenance of dendrites through fundamental processes in RNA splicing, RNA transport and DNA damage response/repair. These results contribute to the understanding of phenotypic manifestations in neurodegeneration related to FUS mutations, and to identify important directions for future investigations.

ALS-causative mutations in FUS/TLS are shown to abnormally enhance their interaction with SMN and dysregulate its function, including loss of Gems and altered levels of small nuclear RNAs. The same mutants are found to have reduced association with U1-snRNP. Correspondingly, global RNA analysis reveals a mutant-dependent loss of splicing activity, with ALS-linked mutants failing to reverse changes caused by loss of wild-type FUS/TLS. Furthermore, a common FUS/TLS mutant-associated RNA splicing signature is identified in ALS patient fibroblasts. Taken together, these studies establish potentially converging disease mechanisms in ALS and spinal muscular atrophy, with ALS-causative mutants acquiring properties representing both gain (dysregulation of SMN) and loss (reduced RNA processing mediated by U1-snRNP) of function.},

@article{Thompson2015,
	abstract = {Retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) poses a substantial threat to genome stability. Transcriptional silencing of a subset of these parasitic elements in early mouse embryonic and germ cell development is dependent upon the lysine methyltransferase SETDB1, which deposits H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and the co-repressor KAP1, which binds SETDB1 when SUMOylated. Here we identified the transcription co-factor hnRNP K as a novel binding partner of the SETDB1/KAP1 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and show that hnRNP K is required for ERV silencing. RNAi-mediated knockdown of hnRNP K led to depletion of H3K9me3 at ERVs, concomitant with de-repression of proviral reporter constructs and specific ERV subfamilies, as well as a cohort of germline-specific genes directly targeted by SETDB1. While hnRNP K recruitment to ERVs is dependent upon KAP1, SETDB1 binding at these elements requires hnRNP K. Furthermore, an intact SUMO conjugation pathway is necessary for SETDB1 recruitment to proviral chromatin and depletion of hnRNP K resulted in reduced SUMOylation at ERVs. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel regulatory hierarchy governing SETDB1 recruitment and in turn, transcriptional silencing in mESCs.},

	abstract = {Analysis of splice variants from short read RNA-seq data remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method for the genome-guided prediction and quantification of splice events from RNA-seq data, which enables the analysis of unannotated and complex splice events. Splice junctions and exons are predicted from reads mapped to a reference genome and are assembled into a genome-wide splice graph. Splice events are identified recursively from the graph and are quantified locally based on reads extending across the start or end of each splice variant. We assess prediction accuracy based on simulated and real RNA-seq data, and illustrate how different read aligners (GSNAP, HISAT2, STAR, TopHat2) affect prediction results. We validate our approach for quantification based on simulated data, and compare local estimates of relative splice variant usage with those from other methods (MISO, Cufflinks) based on simulated and real RNA-seq data. In a proof-of-concept study of splice variants in 16 normal human tissues (Illumina Body Map 2.0) we identify 249 internal exons that belong to known genes but are not related to annotated exons. Using independent RNA samples from 14 matched normal human tissues, we validate 9/9 of these exons by RT-PCR and 216/249 by paired-end RNA-seq (2 x 250 bp). These results indicate that de novo prediction of splice variants remains beneficial even in well-studied systems. An implementation of our method is freely available as an R/Bioconductor package [Formula: see text].},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) make up a half of the human genome, but the extent of their contribution to cryptic exon activation that results in genetic disease is unknown. Here, a comprehensive survey of 78 mutation-induced cryptic exons previously identified in 51 disease genes revealed the presence of TEs in 40 cases (51{\%}). Most TE-containing exons were derived from short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), with Alus and mammalian interspersed repeats (MIRs) covering {\textgreater}18 and {\textgreater}16{\%} of the exonized sequences, respectively. The majority of SINE-derived cryptic exons had splice sites at the same positions of the Alu/MIR consensus as existing SINE exons and their inclusion in the mRNA was facilitated by phylogenetically conserved changes that improved both traditional and auxiliary splicing signals, thus marking intronic TEs amenable for pathogenic exonization. The overrepresentation of MIRs among TE exons is likely to result from their high average exon inclusion levels, which reflect their strong splice sites, a lack of splicing silencers and a high density of enhancers, particularly (G)AA(G) motifs. These elements were markedly depleted in antisense Alu exons, had the most prominent position on the exon-intron gradient scale and are proposed to promote exon definition through enhanced tertiary RNA interactions involving unpaired (di)adenosines. The identification of common mechanisms by which the most dynamic parts of the genome contribute both to new exon creation and genetic disease will facilitate detection of intronic mutations and the development of computational tools that predict TE hot-spots of cryptic exon activation.},

	abstract = {In recent times, high-throughput screening analyses have broadly defined the RNA cellular targets of TDP-43, a nuclear factor involved in neurodegeneration. A common outcome of all these studies is that changing the expression levels of this protein can alter the expression of several hundred RNAs within cells. What still remains to be clarified is which changes represent direct cellular targets of TDP-43 or just secondary variations due to the general role played by this protein in RNA metabolism. Using an HTS-based splicing junction analysis we identified at least six bona fide splicing events that are consistent with being controlled by TDP-43. Validation of the data, both in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines demonstrated that TDP-43 substantially alters the levels of isoform expression in four genes potentially important for neuropathology: MADD/IG20, STAG2, FNIP1 and BRD8. For MADD/IG20 and STAG2, these changes could also be confirmed at the protein level. These alterations were also observed in a cellular model that successfully mimics TDP-43 loss of function effects following its aggregation. Most importantly, our study demonstrates that cell cycle alterations induced by TDP-43 knockdown can be recovered by restoring the STAG2, an important component of the cohesin complex, normal splicing profile.},

Analysis of RNA binding by TDP-43 in brains from subjects with FTLD revealed that the greatest increases in binding were to the MALAT1 and NEAT1 noncoding RNAs. We also found that binding of TDP-43 to pre-mRNAs influenced alternative splicing in a similar position-dependent manner to Nova proteins. In addition, we identified unusually long clusters of TDP-43 binding at deep intronic positions downstream of silenced exons.

	abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical syndrome with a heterogeneous molecular basis. The neuropathology associated with most FTD is characterized by abnormal cellular aggregates of either transactive response DNA-binding protein with Mr 43 kDa (TDP-43) or tau protein. However, we recently described a subgroup of FTD patients, representing around 10{\%}, with an unusual clinical phenotype and pathology characterized by frontotemporal lobar degeneration with neuronal inclusions composed of an unidentified ubiquitinated protein (atypical FTLD-U; aFTLD-U). All cases were sporadic and had early-onset FTD with severe progressive behavioural and personality changes in the absence of aphasia or significant motor features. Mutations in the fused in sarcoma (FUS) gene have recently been identified as a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with these cases reported to have abnormal cellular accumulations of FUS protein. Because of the recognized clinical, genetic and pathological overlap between FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we investigated whether FUS might also be the pathological protein in aFTLD-U. In all our aFTLD-U cases (n = 15), FUS immunohistochemistry labelled all the neuronal inclusions and also demonstrated previously unrecognized glial pathology. Immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from post-mortem aFTLD-U brain tissue demonstrated increased levels of insoluble FUS. No mutations in the FUS gene were identified in any of our patients. These findings suggest that FUS is the pathological protein in a significant subgroup of sporadic FTD and reinforce the concept that FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are closely related conditions.},

	abstract = {Although repetitive elements pervade mammalian genomes, their overall contribution to transcriptional activity is poorly defined. Here, as part of the FANTOM4 project, we report that 6-30{\%} of cap-selected mouse and human RNA transcripts initiate within repetitive elements. Analysis of approximately 250,000 retrotransposon-derived transcription start sites shows that the associated transcripts are generally tissue specific, coincide with gene-dense regions and form pronounced clusters when aligned to full-length retrotransposon sequences. Retrotransposons located immediately 5' of protein-coding loci frequently function as alternative promoters and/or express noncoding RNAs. More than a quarter of RefSeqs possess a retrotransposon in their 3' UTR, with strong evidence for the reduced expression of these transcripts relative to retrotransposon-free transcripts. Finally, a genome-wide screen identifies 23,000 candidate regulatory regions derived from retrotransposons, in addition to more than 2,000 examples of bidirectional transcription. We conclude that retrotransposon transcription has a key influence upon the transcriptional output of the mammalian genome.},

Here we identified {\textgreater}200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance, but, surprisingly, HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3' UTRs. This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns. These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay (NMD), as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels. Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant. The NMD exons were regulated by seizures, which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins, including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. Moreover, Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy. The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output, and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00178.001.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

We addressed this question using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) in mouse brain, which showed that FUS binds along the whole length of the nascent RNA with limited sequence specificity to GGU and related motifs. A saw-tooth binding pattern in long genes demonstrated that FUS remains bound to pre-mRNAs until splicing is completed. Analysis of FUS(-/-) brain demonstrated a role for FUS in alternative splicing, with increased crosslinking of FUS in introns around the repressed exons.

	abstract = {Background Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. Previously we introduced an intermediate approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution that does not rely on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript discovery. However, there were computational challenges involved with performing base-resolution analyses in large numbers of samples at genome scale. Results Here we describe a new version of the derfinder software that allows for: (1) genome- scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) flexible statistical modeling, including multi-group and time course analyses, and (3) a new, computationally efficient approach to re-analysis at base resolution called expressed-region analysis. We also introduce functionality for annotating and plotting base-resolution data to identify artifacts and confirm results. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the developing human brain to illustrate the types of analyses and results possible using derfinder. Conclusions Single-base and expressed-region RNA-sequencing analysis provides compromise be- tween full transcript reconstruction and gene-level analysis. derfinder is software designed to identify, visualize, and interpret differentially expressed regions.

	abstract = {Biologically-based skin substitutes have developed as commercial products over the last 5 years. The first generation includes the collagen-based synthetic device, Integra, and Alloderm, which is based on devitalised and cross-linked human dermis. These are used as dermal replacements for third degree burns. Within the last year, the tissue-engineered product, Dermagraft-TC, has become available. While originally intended as a temporary covering for severe burns, Dermagraft-TC has proved to markedly improve the healing of deep second degree burns. The earliest living skin substitutes used autologous keratinocytes expanded in vitro. Two new products containing living cells, Dermagraft and Apligraf, are expected to be approved shortly for diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers, respectively. Dermagraft is produced by growing human fibroblasts on a three-dimensional scaffold. The cells actively proliferate and lay down extracellular matrix to generate a papillary dermis-like device that shows a combination of angiogenic, growth factor and cell adhesion properties that enhance healing in diabetic foot ulcers. The production of Apligraf includes casting human fibroblasts in collagen, in order to generate a dermal equivalent on which is grown an epidermis. The structure is akin to a skin graft and is so applied. Despite Dermagraft and Apligraf being of allogeneic origin, rejection has not been an issue in clinical trials and possible contamination by pathogens has been eliminated as a concern through extensive testing. These developments represent a new concept and are expected to revolutionise wound care. They may also provide a platform for gene therapy applications.},

HITS-CLIP analysis of the neuron-specific splicing factor Nova revealed extremely reproducible RNA-binding maps in multiple mouse brains. These maps provide genome-wide in vivo biochemical footprints confirming the previous prediction that the position of Nova binding determines the outcome of alternative splicing; moreover, they are sufficiently powerful to predict Nova action de novo. HITS-CLIP revealed a large number of Nova-RNA interactions in 3' untranslated regions, leading to the discovery that Nova regulates alternative polyadenylation in the brain.

	abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprised of five snRNPs and numerous proteins. Intricate RNA-RNA and RNP networks, which serve to align the reactive groups of the pre-mRNA for catalysis, are formed and repeatedly rearranged during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. Both the conformation and composition of the spliceosome are highly dynamic, affording the splicing machinery its accuracy and flexibility, and these remarkable dynamics are largely conserved between yeast and metazoans. Because of its dynamic and complex nature, obtaining structural information about the spliceosome represents a major challenge. Electron microscopy has revealed the general morphology of several spliceosomal complexes and their snRNP subunits, and also the spatial arrangement of some of their components. X-ray and NMR studies have provided high resolution structure information about spliceosomal proteins alone or complexed with one or more binding partners. The extensive interplay of RNA and proteins in aligning the pre-mRNA's reactive groups, and the presence of both RNA and protein at the core of the splicing machinery, suggest that the spliceosome is an RNP enzyme. However, elucidation of the precise nature of the spliceosome's active site, awaits the generation of a high-resolution structure of its RNP core.},

	abstract = {In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, nascent transcripts are associated with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles that are nucleated by hnRNP C. Despite their abundance, however, it remained unclear whether these particles control pre-mRNA processing. Here, we developed individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to study the role of hnRNP C in splicing regulation. iCLIP data show that hnRNP C recognizes uridine tracts with a defined long-range spacing consistent with hnRNP particle organization. hnRNP particles assemble on both introns and exons but remain generally excluded from splice sites. Integration of transcriptome-wide iCLIP data and alternative splicing profiles into an 'RNA map' indicates how the positioning of hnRNP particles determines their effect on the inclusion of alternative exons. The ability of high-resolution iCLIP data to provide insights into the mechanism of this regulation holds promise for studies of other higher-order ribonucleoprotein complexes.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome has proven valuable to the study of neurodegenerative disorders. To identify new protein/pathway alterations and candidate biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we performed comparative proteomic profiling of CSF from sporadic ALS (sALS), healthy control (HC), and other neurological disease (OND) subjects using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 1712 CSF proteins were detected and relatively quantified by spectral counting. Levels of several proteins with diverse biological functions were significantly altered in sALS samples. Enrichment analysis was used to link these alterations to biological pathways, which were predominantly related to inflammation, neuronal activity, and extracellular matrix regulation. We then used our CSF proteomic profiles to create a support vector machines classifier capable of discriminating training set ALS from non-ALS (HC and OND) samples. Four classifier proteins, WD repeat-containing protein 63, amyloid-like protein 1, SPARC-like protein 1, and cell adhesion molecule 3, were identified by feature selection and externally validated. The resultant classifier distinguished ALS from non-ALS samples with 83{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity in an independent test set. Collectively, our results illustrate the utility of CSF proteomic profiling for identifying ALS protein/pathway alterations and candidate disease biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The phenotypic consequences of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are presumably due to their effects on protein expression levels. Yet the impact of genetic variation, including eQTLs, on protein levels remains poorly understood. To address this, we mapped genetic variants that are associated with eQTLs, ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). We found that most QTLs are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, which suggests that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we identified a class of cis QTLs that affect protein abundance with little or no effect on messenger RNA or ribosome levels, which suggests that they may arise from differences in posttranslational regulation.},

We identified a specific splicing enhancer element that regulates the inclusion of a sortilin exon cassette (termed Ex17b) not normally present in the mature sortilin mRNA. This enhancer element is consistently present in sortilin RNA of mice and other species but absent in primates, which carry a premature stop codon within the Ex17b sequence. In the absence of TDP-43, which acts as a regulatory inhibitor, Ex17b is included in the sortilin mRNA. In humans, in contrast to mice, the inclusion of Ex17b in sortilin mRNA generates a truncated, nonfunctional, extracellularly released protein that binds to but does not internalize PGRN, essentially acting as a decoy receptor. Based on these results, we propose a potential mechanism linking misregulation of sortilin splicing with altered PGRN metabolism.},

To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

	abstract = {In recent times, high-throughput screening analyses have broadly defined the RNA cellular targets of TDP-43, a nuclear factor involved in neurodegeneration. A common outcome of all these studies is that changing the expression levels of this protein can alter the expression of several hundred RNAs within cells. What still remains to be clarified is which changes represent direct cellular targets of TDP-43 or just secondary variations due to the general role played by this protein in RNA metabolism. Using an HTS-based splicing junction analysis we identified at least six bona fide splicing events that are consistent with being controlled by TDP-43. Validation of the data, both in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines demonstrated that TDP-43 substantially alters the levels of isoform expression in four genes potentially important for neuropathology: MADD/IG20, STAG2, FNIP1 and BRD8. For MADD/IG20 and STAG2, these changes could also be confirmed at the protein level. These alterations were also observed in a cellular model that successfully mimics TDP-43 loss of function effects following its aggregation. Most importantly, our study demonstrates that cell cycle alterations induced by TDP-43 knockdown can be recovered by restoring the STAG2, an important component of the cohesin complex, normal splicing profile.},

The newly developed second generation sequencing technique provides high-throughput data (RNA-seq data) to study alternative splicing events in different types of cells. Here, we present a computational method, SpliceMap, to detect splice junctions from RNA-seq data. This method does not depend on any existing annotation of gene structures and is capable of finding novel splice junctions with high sensitivity and specificity. It can handle long reads (50-100 nt) and can exploit paired-read information to improve mapping accuracy. Several parameters are included in the output to indicate the reliability of the predicted junction and help filter out false predictions. We applied SpliceMap to analyze 23 million paired 50-nt reads from human brain tissue. The results show at this depth of sequencing, RNA-seq can support reliable detection of splice junctions except for those that are present at very low level. Compared to current methods, SpliceMap can achieve 12{\%} higher sensitivity without sacrificing specificity.},

Even when AIR can be detected, results are often counterintuitive and interpretation non-trivial. We introduce JunctionSeq, a new method based on the popular and well-established DEXSeq method, but designed to detect differential usage of both exonic regions and known/novel splice junctions. In addition to broadening the class of regulatory phenomena that can be detected, JunctionSeq provides a powerful and streamlined visualization and interpretation toolset that allows bioinformaticians to quickly and intuitively assess, evaluate, and characterize the detected differentials and design follow-up experiments.

	abstract = {Mutations in the optineurin (OPTN) gene have been implicated in both familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of this protein in the central nervous system (CNS) and how it may contribute to ALS pathology are unclear. Here, we found that optineurin actively suppressed receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent signaling by regulating its turnover. Loss of OPTN led to progressive dysmyelination and axonal degeneration through engagement of necroptotic machinery in the CNS, including RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain–like protein (MLKL). Furthermore, RIPK1-and RIPK3-mediated axonal pathology was commonly observed in SOD1 G93A transgenic mice and pathological samples from human ALS patients. Thus, RIPK1 and RIPK3 play a critical role in mediating progressive axonal degeneration. Furthermore, inhibiting RIPK1 kinase may provide an axonal protective strategy for the treatment of ALS and other human degenerative diseases characterized by axonal degeneration.},

We used PAR-CLIP, a recently developed method based on RNA-protein crosslinking, to identify transcriptome-wide {\~{}}26,000 HuR binding sites. These sites were on average highly conserved, enriched for HuR binding motifs and mainly located in 3??? untranslated regions. Surprisingly, many sites were intronic, implicating HuR in mRNA processing. Upon HuR knockdown, mRNA levels and protein synthesis of thousands of target genes were downregulated, validating functionality. HuR and miRNA binding sites tended to reside nearby but generally did not overlap. Additionally, HuR knockdown triggered strong and specific upregulation of miR-7. In summary, we identified thousands of direct and functional HuR targets, found a human miRNA controlled by HuR, and propose a role for HuR in splicing. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys.

We generated human cell lines expressing tagged forms of wild-type and mutant TDP-43 and observed that TDP-43 controls its own expression through a negative feedback loop. The RNA-binding properties of TDP-43 are essential for the autoregulatory activity through binding to 3' UTR sequences in its own mRNA. Our analysis indicated that the C-terminal region of TDP-43, which mediates TDP-43-hnRNP interactions, is also required for self-regulation. TDP-43 binding to its 3' UTR does not significantly change the pre-mRNA splicing pattern but promotes RNA instability. Moreover, blocking exosome-mediated degradation partially recovers TDP-43 levels. Our findings demonstrate that cellular TDP-43 levels are under tight control and it is likely that disease-associated TDP-43 aggregates disrupt TDP-43 self-regulation, thus contributing to pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disease that causes motor neuron degeneration, progressive motor dysfunction, paralysis, and death. Although multiple causes have been identified for this disease, {\textgreater}95{\%} of ALS cases show aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) accompanied by its nuclear depletion. Therefore, the TDP-43 pathology may be a converging point in the pathogenesis that originates from various initial triggers. The aggregation is thought to result from TDP-43 misfolding, which could generate cellular toxicity. However, the aggregation as well as the nuclear depletion could also lead to a partial loss of TDP-43 function or TDP-43 dysfunction. To investigate the impact of TDP-43 dysfunction, we generated a transgenic mouse model for a partial loss of TDP-43 function using transgenic RNAi. These mice show ubiquitous transgene expression and TDP-43 knockdown in both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Strikingly, these mice develop progressive neurodegeneration prominently in cortical layer V and spinal ventral horn, motor dysfunction, paralysis, and death. Furthermore, examination of splicing patterns of TDP-43 target genes in human ALS revealed changes consistent with TDP-43 dysfunction. These results suggest that the CNS, particularly motor neurons, possess a heightened vulnerability to TDP-43 dysfunction. Additionally, because TDP-43 knockdown predominantly occur in astrocytes in the spinal cord of these mice, our results suggest that TDP-43 dysfunction in astrocytes is an important driver for motor neuron degeneration and clinical phenotypes of ALS.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Mapping high throughput sequencing data to a reference genome is an essential step for most analysis pipelines aiming at the computational analysis of genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Breaking ties between equally well mapping locations poses a severe problem not only during the alignment phase, but also has significant impact on the results of downstream analyses. We present the multimapper resolution (MMR) tool that infers optimal mapping locations from the coverage density of other mapped reads. Results: Filtering alignments with MMR can significantly improve the performance of downstream analyses like transcript quantitation and differential testing. We illustrate that the accuracy (Spearman correlation) of transcript quantification increases by 17{\%} when using reads of length 51. In addition, MMR decreases the alignment file sizes by more than 50{\%} and this leads to a reduced running time of the quantification tool. Our efficient implementation of the MMR algorithm is easily applicable as a post-processing step to existing alignment files in BAM format. Its complexity scales linearly with the number of alignments and requires no further inputs.

It remains unclear if aggregated TDP-43 is neurotoxic and if ∼50 ALS-associated missense mutations in TDP-43 CTD promote aggregation, or if loss of normal function plays a role in disease. Recent work points to the ability of related proteins to assemble into functional phase-separated ribonucleoprotein granules via their structurally disordered prion-like domains. Here, we provide atomic details on the structure and assembly of the low-complexity CTD of TDP-43 into liquid-liquid phase-separated in vitro granules and demonstrate that ALS-associated variants disrupt interactions within granules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, simulation, and microscopy, we find that a subregion cooperatively but transiently folds into a helix that mediates TDP-43 phase separation. ALS-associated mutations disrupt phase separation by inhibiting interaction and helical stabilization. Therefore, ALS-associated mutations can disrupt TDP-43 interactions, affecting function beyond encouraging aggregation.},

Ataxin-2 with intermediate length of polyglutamine expansions (Ataxin-2 Q30x) is a genetic modifier of the disease. Here, we found that C9ORF72 forms a complex with theWDR41 andSMCR8 proteins to act as aGDP/GTPexchange factor forRAB8a andRAB39b and to thereby control autophagic flux. Depletion of C9orf72 in neurons partly impairs autophagy and leads to accumulation of aggregates ofTDP-43 and P62 proteins, which are histopathological hallmarks ofALS-FTDSMCR8 is phosphorylated byTBK1 and depletion ofTBK1 can be rescued by phosphomimetic mutants ofSMCR8 or by constitutively activeRAB39b, suggesting thatTBK1,SMCR8, C9ORF72, andRAB39b belong to a common pathway regulating autophagy. While depletion of C9ORF72 only has a partial deleterious effect on neuron survival, it synergizes with Ataxin-2 Q30x toxicity to induce motor neuron dysfunction and neuronal cell death. These results indicate that partial loss of function of C9ORF72 is not deleterious by itself but synergizes with Ataxin-2 toxicity, suggesting a double-hit pathological mechanism inALS-FTD.},

To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres{\_}lab/brain{\_}rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

@article{Zhao2018,
	abstract = {To allow efficient transcript/gene detection, highly abundant ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) are generally removed from total RNA either by positive polyA+ selection or by rRNA depletion (negative selection) before sequencing. Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two RNA sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that rRNA depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas polyA+ selection outperformed rRNA depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood-and colon-derived RNAs, we found that 220{\%} and 50{\%} more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the rRNA depletion method compared with the polyA+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend polyA+ selection over rRNA depletion for gene quantification in clinical RNA sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of lncRNAs and small RNAs made up a large fraction of the reads in the rRNA depletion RNA sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these RNAs are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining RNAs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revolutionized the way biologists examine transcriptomes and has been successfully applied in biological research, drug discovery, and clinical development 1-3. Compared with microarray-based transcriptome profiling, RNA-seq has a wider dynamic range and avoids some of the technical limitations such as varying probe performance and cross-hybridization 4. RNA-seq can measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and provide insights into functional pathways and the regulatory networks in biological systems. In addition, RNA-seq can provide novel insights into alternative splicing 5 , unan-notated exons, and novel transcripts 6. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the most highly abundant component of total RNA isolated from animal or human cells and tissues, comprising the majority ({\textgreater}80{\%} to 90{\%}) of the molecules in a total RNA sample 7. To allow efficient transcript/gene detection, highly abundant rRNAs must be removed from total RNA before sequenc-ing. Standard approaches include selection of polyadenylated RNA (polyA) transcripts using oligo (dT) primers, and depletion of highly abundant rRNAs through hybridization capture followed by magnetic bead separation. However, the polyA+ selection and rRNA depletion methods each have unique advantages and limitations. polyA+ selection is used for most transcriptome studies because the sequencing depth required is relatively low when the focus is mainly on the protein-coding fraction of a transcriptome 8. Several recent studies have noted that although rRNA-depleted RNA libraries cost more than polyA+ selection libraries to achieve comparable coverage of protein-coding reads in a transcriptome, it provides more information on polyA-transcripts. Another technical advantage that favours RNA-seq of rRNA-depleted libraries compared with polyA-selected libraries is that its performance is better for degraded RNAs 8-12. Since 2010, comparisons between polyA+ selection and rRNA depletion methods have been carried out by various groups using different kits, cell lines, and samples 8,10,11,13-16.

We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and found a large fraction of reads (up to 40{\%}) within introns. Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing. Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal brain development.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons. Although several genes are identified as the cause of familial cases, the pathogeneses of sporadic forms, which account for 90{\%} of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have not been elucidated. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 a nuclear protein regulating RNA processing, redistributes to the cytoplasm and forms aggregates, which are the histopathological hallmark of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in affected motor neurons, suggesting that loss-of-function of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 is one of the causes of the neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of knockout of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 in mouse postnatal motor neurons using Cre/loxp system. These mice developed progressive weight loss and motor impairment around the age of 60 weeks, and exhibited degeneration of large motor axon, grouped atrophy of the skeletal muscle, and denervation in the neuromuscular junction. The spinal motor neurons lacking transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 were not affected for 1 year, but exhibited atrophy at the age of 100 weeks; whereas, extraocular motor neurons, that are essentially resistant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, remained preserved even at the age of 100 weeks. Additionally, ultra structural analysis revealed autolysosomes and autophagosomes in the cell bodies and axons of motor neurons of the 100-week-old knockout mice. In summary, the mice in which transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 was knocked-out specifically in postnatal motor neurons exhibited an age-dependent progressive motor dysfunction accompanied by neuropathological alterations, which are common to sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These findings suggest that transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 plays an essential role in the long term maintenance of motor neurons and that loss-of-function of this protein seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

Here, we assess the interplay of splicing repression by hnRNPC and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the quality control and evolution of new Alu-exons. We identify 3100 new Alu-exons and show that NMD more efficiently recognises transcripts with Alu-exons compared to other exons with premature termination codons. However, some Alu-exons escape NMD, especially when an adjacent intron is retained, highlighting the importance of concerted repression by splicing and NMD. We show that evolutionary progression of 3' splice sites is coupled with longer repressive uridine tracts. Once the 3' splice site at ancient Alu-exons reaches a stable phase, splicing repression by hnRNPC decreases, but the exons generally remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that repressive motifs are strongest next to cryptic exons and that gradual weakening of these motifs contributes to the evolutionary emergence of new alternative exons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We introduce JunctionSeq, a new method that builds on the statistical techniques used by the well-established DEXSeq package to detect differential usage of both exonic regions and splice junctions. In particular, JunctionSeq is capable of detecting differential usage of novel splice junctions without the need for an additional isoform assembly step, greatly improving performance when the available transcript annotation is flawed or incomplete. JunctionSeq also provides a powerful and streamlined visualization toolset that allows bioinformaticians to quickly and intuitively interpret their results. We tested our method on publicly available data from several experiments performed on the rat pineal gland and Toxoplasma gondii, successfully detecting known and previously validated AIR genes in 19 out of 19 gene-level hypothesis tests. Due to its ability to query novel splice sites, JunctionSeq is still able to detect these differences even when all alternative isoforms for these genes were not included in the transcript annotation. JunctionSeq thus provides a powerful method for detecting alternative isoform regulation even with low-quality annotations. An implementation of JunctionSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing plays an essential role in many cellular processes and bears major relevance in the understanding of multiple diseases, including cancer. High-throughput RNA sequencing allows genome-wide analyses of splicing across multiple conditions. However, the increasing number of available data sets represents a major challenge in terms of computation time and storage requirements. We describe SUPPA, a computational tool to calculate relative inclusion values of alternative splicing events, exploiting fast transcript quantification. SUPPA accuracy is comparable and sometimes superior to standard methods using simulated as well as real RNA-sequencing data compared with experimentally validated events. We assess the variability in terms of the choice of annotation and provide evidence that using complete transcripts rather than more transcripts per gene provides better estimates. Moreover, SUPPA coupled with de novo transcript reconstruction methods does not achieve accuracies as high as using quantification of known transcripts, but remains comparable to existing methods. Finally, we show that SUPPA is more than 1000 times faster than standard methods. Coupled with fast transcript quantification, SUPPA provides inclusion values at a much higher speed than existing methods without compromising accuracy, thereby facilitating the systematic splicing analysis of large data sets with limited computational resources. The software is implemented in Python 2.7 and is available under the MIT license at https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa.},

	abstract = {The frequency distribution of mutation-induced aberrant 3' splice sites (3'ss) in exons and introns is more complex than for 5' splice sites, largely owing to sequence constraints upstream of intron/exon boundaries. As a result, prediction of their localization remains a challenging task. Here, nucleotide sequences of previously reported 218 aberrant 3'ss activated by disease-causing mutations in 131 human genes were compared with their authentic counterparts using currently available splice site prediction tools. Each tested algorithm distinguished authentic 3'ss from cryptic sites more effectively than from de novo sites. The best discrimination between aberrant and authentic 3'ss was achieved by the maximum entropy model. Almost one half of aberrant 3'ss was activated by AG-creating mutations and approximately 95{\%} of the newly created AGs were selected in vivo. The overall nucleotide structure upstream of aberrant 3'ss was characterized by higher purine content than for authentic sites, particularly in position -3, that may be compensated by more stringent requirements for positive and negative nucleotide signatures centred around position -11. A newly developed online database of aberrant 3'ss will facilitate identification of splicing mutations in a gene or phenotype of interest and future optimization of splice site prediction tools.},

	abstract = {Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a predominantly nuclear, ubiquitously expressed RNA and DNA-binding protein. It recognizes and binds to UG repeats and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and microRNA metabolism. TDP-43 is essential in early embryonic development but accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It is not known yet whether cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are toxic or protective but they are often associated with a loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus and neurodegeneration may be caused by a loss of normal TDP-43 function or a gain of toxic function. Here we present a proteomic study to analyze the effect of loss of TDP-43 on the proteome. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001668. Our results indicate that TDP-43 is an important regulator of RNA metabolism and intracellular transport. We show that Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (Dnmt3a) and chromogranin B (CgB) are downregulated upon TDP-43 knockdown. Subsequently, transportin 1 level is increased as a result of RanBP1 depletion. Improper regulation of these proteins and the subsequent disruption of cellular processes may play a role in the pathogenesis of the TDP-43 proteinopathies ALS and FTLD.},

The embryonic-to-postnatal axonal translatome comprises an evolving subset of enriched genes with axon-specific roles, suggesting distinct steps in axon wiring, such as elongation, pruning, and synaptogenesis. Adult axons, remarkably, have a complex translatome with strong links to axon survival, neurotransmission, and neurodegenerative disease. Translationally co-regulated mRNA subsets share common upstream regulators, and sequence elements generated by alternative splicing promote axonal mRNA translation.

An important characteristic of these systems is the rise-time: the delay from the initiation of production until half maximal product concentration is reached. Here we employ synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli to measure the rise-times of non-self-regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units. Non-self-regulated units have a rise-time of one cell-cycle. We demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback (also termed autogenous control) reduces the rise-time to about one fifth of a cell-cycle. This agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation. This may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation, which appears in over 40{\%} of known transcription factors in E. coli. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TDP-43 is predominantly located in the nucleus, however, in disease it mislocalizes to the cytoplasm where it aggregates to form hallmark pathological inclusions. The identification of TDP-43 mutations in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases confirms its pathogenic role; but it is wild-type TDP-43 that is deposited in the vast majority of TDP-43 proteinopathies, implicating other unknown factors for its mislocalization and aggregation. One such mechanism may be defective nuclear import of TDP-43 protein, as a disruption of its nuclear localization signal leads to mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. In order to explore the factors that regulate the nuclear import of TDP-43, we used a small interfering RNA library to silence 82 proteins involved in nuclear transport and found that knockdowns of karyopherin-beta1 and cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein resulted in marked cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, TDP-43 bound to karyopherin-alphas, thereby confirming the classical nuclear import pathway for the import of TDP-43. Analysis of the expression of chosen nuclear import factors in post-mortem brain samples from patients with TDP-43 positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and spinal cord samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, revealed a considerable reduction in expression of cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We propose that cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein associated defective nuclear transport may play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of the TDP-43 positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration.},

It remains unclear whether such mechanisms contribute to other familial forms, such as TDP-43 and FUS-associated ALS. Here, we characterize a single-copy mouse model of ALS-FUS that conditionally expresses a disease-relevant truncating FUS mutant from the endogenous murine Fus gene. We show that these mice, but not mice heterozygous for a Fus null allele, develop similar pathology as ALS-FUS patients and a mild motor neuron phenotype. Most importantly, CRE-mediated rescue of the Fus mutation within motor neurons prevented degeneration of motor neuron cell bodies, but only delayed appearance of motor symptoms. Indeed, we observed downregulation of multiple myelin-related genes, and increased numbers of oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord supporting their contribution to behavioral deficits. In all, we show that mutant FUS triggers toxic events in both motor neurons and neighboring cells to elicit motor neuron disease.},

	abstract = {Tar DNA Binding Protein-43 (TDP-43) is a principle component of inclusions in many cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 resides predominantly in the nucleus, but in affected areas of ALS and FTLD-U central nervous system, TDP-43 is aberrantly processed and forms cytoplasmic inclusions. The mechanisms governing TDP-43 inclusion formation are poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that TDP-43 regulates mRNA metabolism by interacting with mRNA binding proteins that are known to associate with RNA granules. Here we show that TDP-43 can be induced to form inclusions in cell culture and that most TDP-43 inclusions co-localize with SGs. SGs are cytoplasmic RNA granules that consist of mixed protein-RNA complexes. Under stressful conditions SGs are generated by the reversible aggregation of prion-like proteins, such as TIA-1, to regulate mRNA metabolism and protein translation. We also show that disease-linked mutations in TDP-43 increased TDP-43 inclusion formation in response to stressful stimuli. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the increased TDP-43 inclusion formation is associated with accumulation of TDP-43 detergent insoluble complexes. TDP-43 associates with SG by interacting with SG proteins, such as TIA-1, via direct protein-protein interactions, as well as RNA-dependent interactions. The signaling pathway that regulates SGs formation also modulates TDP-43 inclusion formation. We observed that inclusion formation mediated by WT or mutant TDP-43 can be suppressed by treatment with translational inhibitors that suppress or reverse SG formation. Finally, using Sudan black to quench endogenous autofluorescence, we also demonstrate that TDP-43 positive-inclusions in pathological CNS tissue co-localize with multiple protein markers of stress granules, including TIA-1 and eIF3. These data provide support for accumulating evidence that TDP-43 participates in the SG pathway.},

	abstract = {Polypyrimdine tract binding protein (PTB) is a regulator of alternative splicing, mRNA 3′ end formation, mRNA stability and localization, and IRES-mediated translation. Transient overexpression of PTB can influence alternative splicing, sometimes resulting in nonphysiological splicing patterns. Here, we show that alternative skipping of PTB exon 11 leads to an mRNA that is removed by NMD and that this pathway consumes at least 20{\%} of the PTB mRNA in HeLa cells. We also show that exon 11 skipping is itself promoted by PTB in a negative feedback loop. This autoregulation may serve both to prevent disruptively high levels of PTB expression and to restore nuclear levels when PTB is mobilized to the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that alternative splicing can act not only to generate protein isoform diversity but also to quantitatively control gene expression and complement recent bioinformatic analyses, indicating a high prevalence of human alternative splicing leading to NMD.},

	abstract = {A myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are destructive neurodegenerative diseases that exist on a clinicopathological spectrum (ALS-FTD) 1 . ALS is characterized by motor impairment and FTD by executive dysfunction, language impairment and behavioral changes. Nearly all cases of ALS, half of FTD cases, and most hereditary forms of ALS and FTD are characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 2,3 . The identification of mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 (TARDBP) as a cause of ALS and FTD confirmed that TDP-43 plays a mechanistic role in neurodegenera-tion 4,5 . This role remains undefined. TDP-43 is a conserved RNA-binding protein with critical roles in splicing in the nervous system 6 . TDP-43 also demonstrates tight autoregulation by binding to its transcript, triggering alternative splicing of intron 7 in the TARDBP 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and destruction of its mRNA 7 . Experimentally increasing and decreasing TDP-43 levels both cause neuronal loss, but whether human neurodegeneration is caused by a gain or loss of TDP-43 function remains unclear. Modeling of mutant TDP-43 in vivo has relied on variable degrees of transgenic overexpression of TDP-43 to replicate pathological changes seen in postmortem human tissues 8 . However, TDP-43 transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that TDP-43 aggregation is not necessary to cause neurodegenera-tion 9 , and whether TDP-43 aggregation is causally linked to disease onset is unclear. A caveat of transgenic TDP-43 mouse models is that pheno-types may partly be artifacts of overexpression. Furthermore, the cell-type-specific expression of single TDP-43 splice forms in trans-genic models using neuronal promoters and temporally triggered expression of transgenes in adulthood do not reflect the ubiquitous expression and alternative splicing of Tardbp, including that occur-ring during embryonic development 10 . To unravel the role of mutant TDP-43 in the disease pathogenesis, we created a knock-in mouse harboring only a human-equivalent point mutation in the endog-enous mouse Tardbp gene. This model replicates the human mutant state as closely as possible, retaining the endogenous gene structure Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) constitutes a devastating disease spectrum character-ized by 43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology. Understanding how TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration will help direct therapeutic efforts.

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) patterns have diverged rapidly during vertebrate evolution, yet the functions of most species- and lineage-specific splicing events are not known. We observe that mammalian-specific AS events are enriched in transcript sequences encoding intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, in particular those containing glycine/tyrosine repeats that mediate formation of higher-order protein assemblies implicated in gene regulation and human disease. These evolutionary changes impact nearly all members of the hnRNP A and D families of RNA binding proteins. Regulation of these events requires formation of unusual, long-range mammalian-specific RNA duplexes. Differential inclusion of the alternative exons controls the formation of tyrosine-dependent multivalent hnRNP assemblies that, in turn, function to globally regulate splicing. Together, our results demonstrate that AS control of IDR-mediated interactions between hnRNPs represents an important and recurring mechanism underlying splicing regulation. Furthermore, this mechanism has expanded the regulatory capacity of mammalian cells.},

	abstract = {Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing remodels the human transcriptome in a spatiotemporal manner during normal development and differentiation. Here we explored the landscape of transcript diversity in the erythroid lineage by RNA-seq analysis of five highly purified populations of morphologically distinct human erythroblasts, representing the last four cell divisions before enucleation. In this unique differentiation system, we found evidence of an extensive and dynamic alternative splicing program encompassing genes with many diverse functions. Alternative splicing was particularly enriched in genes controlling cell cycle, organelle organization, chromatin function and RNA processing. Many alternative exons exhibited differentiation-associated switches in splicing efficiency, mostly in late-stage polychromatophilic and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts, in concert with extensive cellular remodeling that precedes enucleation. A subset of alternative splicing switches introduces premature translation termination codons into selected transcripts in a differentiation stage-specific manner, supporting the hypothesis that alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated decay contributes to regulation of erythroid-expressed genes as a novel part of the overall differentiation program. We conclude that a highly dynamic alternative splicing program in terminally differentiating erythroblasts plays a major role in regulating gene expression to ensure synthesis of appropriate proteome at each stage as the cells remodel in preparation for production of mature red cells.},

Our previous studies demonstrated that the SR proteins ASF/SF2 and SC35 bind specifically an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) within exon 3 and promote exon 3 splicing. In the present study, we show that the ESE is necessary only in the proper context. In addition, we have characterized two novel sequences in the flanking introns that modulate apoA-II exon 3 splicing. There is a G-rich element in intron 2 that interacts with hnRNPH1 and inhibits exon 3 splicing. The second is a purine rich region in intron 3 that binds SRp40 and SRp55 and promotes exon 3 inclusion in mRNA. We have also found that the (GU) repeats in the apoA-II context bind the splicing factor TDP-43 and interfere with exon 3 definition. Significantly, blocking of TDP-43 expression by small interfering RNA overrides the need for all the other cis-acting elements making exon 3 inclusion constitutive even in the presence of disrupted exonic and intronic enhancers. Altogether, our results suggest that exonic and intronic enhancers have evolved to balance the negative effects of the two silencers located in intron 2 and hence rescue the constitutive exon 3 inclusion in apoA-II mRNA.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s) Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FUS is a multifunctional protein involved in the biogenesis and activity of several types of RNAs, and its role in the pathogenesis of ALS may involve both direct effects of disease-associated mutations through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms and indirect effects due to the cross talk between different classes of FUS-dependent RNAs. To explore how FUS mutations impinge on motor neuron-specific RNA-based circuitries, we performed transcriptome profiling of small and long RNAs of motor neurons (MNs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a FUS-P517L knock-in mutation, which is equivalent to human FUS-P525L, associated with a severe and juvenile-onset form of ALS. Combining ontological, predictive and molecular analyses, we found an inverse correlation between several classes of deregulated miRNAs and their corresponding mRNA targets in both homozygous and heterozygous P517L MNs. We validated a circuitry in which the upregulation of miR-409-3p and miR-495-3p, belonging to a brain-specific miRNA subcluster implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, produced the downregulation of Gria2, a subunit of the glutamate $\alpha$‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor with a significant role in excitatory neurotransmission. Moreover, we found that FUS was involved in mediating such miRNA repression. Gria2 alteration has been proposed to be implicated in MN degeneration, through disturbance of Ca 2+ homeostasis, which triggers a cascade of damaging “excitotoxic” events. The molecular cross talk identified highlights a role for FUS in excitotoxicity and in miRNA-dependent regulation of Gria2. This circuitry also proved to be deregulated in heterozygosity, which matches the human condition perfectly.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes. Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well understood. In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A)(+) RNA-seq data, we observe that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly correlated set of cis features comprising an "IR code" reliably discriminates retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that IR acts widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected. This "transcriptome tuning" function of IR acts through both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover of IR transcripts. We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts.},

In trying to model FUS-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in mouse it is clear that FUS is dosage-sensitive and effects arise from overexpression per se in transgenic strains. Novel models are required that maintain physiological levels of FUS expression and that recapitulate the human disease—with progressive loss of motor neurons in heterozygous animals. Here, we describe a new humanized FUS-ALS mouse with a frameshift mutation, which fulfils both criteria: the FUS Delta14 mouse. Heterozygous animals express mutant humanized FUS protein at physiological levels and have adult onset progressive motor neuron loss and denervation of neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, we generated a novel antibody to the unique human frameshift peptide epitope, allowing specific identification of mutant FUS only. Using our new FUSDelta14 ALS mouse-antibody system we show that neurodegeneration occurs in the absence of FUS protein aggregation. FUS mislocalization increases as disease progresses, and mutant FUS accumulates at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Further, transcriptomic analyses show progressive changes in ribosomal protein levels and mitochondrial function as early disease stages are initiated. Thus, our new physiological mouse model has provided novel insight into the early pathogenesis of FUS-ALS.},

A fundamental question is whether toxicity is driven by the repeat RNA itself and/or by dipeptide repeat proteins generated by repeat-associated, non-ATG translation. To address this question, we developed in vitro and in vivo models to dissect repeat RNA and dipeptide repeat protein toxicity. Expression of pure repeats, but not stop codon-interrupted "RNA-only" repeats in Drosophila caused adult-onset neurodegeneration. Thus, expanded repeats promoted neurodegeneration through dipeptide repeat proteins. Expression of individual dipeptide repeat proteins with a non-GGGGCC RNA sequence revealed that both poly-(glycine-arginine) and poly-(proline-arginine) proteins caused neurodegeneration. These findings are consistent with a dual toxicity mechanism, whereby both arginine-rich proteins and repeat RNA contribute to C9orf72-mediated neurodegeneration.},

In this study, we examine the extent of alternative splicing in human cells using deep RNA sequencing and de novo identification of splice junctions. We demonstrate the existence of a large class of low abundance isoforms, encompassing approximately 150,000 previously unannotated splice junctions in our data. Newly-identified splice sites show little evidence of evolutionary conservation, suggesting that the majority are due to erroneous splice site choice. We show that sequence motifs involved in the recognition of exons are enriched in the vicinity of unconserved splice sites. We estimate that the average intron has a splicing error rate of approximately 0.7{\%} and show that introns in highly expressed genes are spliced more accurately, likely due to their shorter length. These results implicate noisy splicing as an important property of genome evolution.},

Knockout mice showed transcriptome alterations including upregulation of Taf15 and Hnrnpa1, while they have normal morphology of RNA-related granules such as Gems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, FUS/TLS depletion causes phenotypes possibly related to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, but distinct from ALS and ET, together with specific alterations in RNA metabolisms.},

To investigate the function of TAF15, an RBP recently implicated in ALS, we explored its target RNA repertoire in normal human brain and mouse neurons. Coupling high-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated and crosslinked RNA with RNA sequencing and TAF15 knockdowns, we identified conserved TAF15 RNA targets and assessed the impact of TAF15 on the neuronal transcriptome. We describe a role of TAF15 in the regulation of splicing for a set of neuronal RNAs encoding proteins with essential roles in synaptic activities. We find that TAF15 is required for a critical alternative splicing event of the zeta-1 subunit of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (Grin1) that controls the activity and trafficking of NR1. Our study uncovers neuronal RNA networks impacted by TAF15 and sets the stage for investigating the role of TAF15 in ALS pathogenesis.},

We identified circRNAs expressed in in vitro-derived mouse motor neurons (MNs) and determined that the production of a considerable number of these circRNAs is regulated by FUS. Using RNAi and overexpression of wild-type and ALS-associated FUS mutants, we directly correlate the modulation of circRNA biogenesis with alteration of FUS nuclear levels and with putative toxic gain of function activities. We also demonstrate that FUS regulates circRNA biogenesis by binding the introns flanking the back-splicing junctions and that this control can be reproduced with artificial constructs. Most circRNAs are conserved in humans and specific ones are deregulated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs carrying the FUS(P525L) mutation associated with ALS.},

We found that FUS, an RNA/DNA-binding protein that has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is important for the DNA damage response (DDR). The function of FUS in DDR involved a direct interaction with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and the recruitment of FUS to double-stranded break sites was important for proper DDR signaling. Notably, FUS proteins carrying familial ALS mutations were defective in DDR and DNA repair and showed a diminished interaction with HDAC1. Moreover, we observed increased DNA damage in human ALS patients harboring FUS mutations. Our findings suggest that an impaired DDR and DNA repair may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases linked to FUS mutations.},

Strikingly, the levels of soluble Unc119 are strongly reduced upon poly-gA expression in neurons, suggesting a loss of function mechanism. Similar to poly-gA expression, Unc119 knockdown inhibits den-dritic branching and causes neurotoxicity.

In C9orf72 patients, Unc119 is detectable in 9.5 {\%} of gA inclusions in the frontal cortex, but only in 1.6 {\%} of gA inclusions in the cerebellum, an area largely spared of neu-rodegeneration.

These transcripts are apparent targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that selectively degrades nonsense mRNAs. Several of these transcripts are from genes for which alternative splicing is known to regulate protein expression by generating alternate isoforms that are differentially subjected to NMD.

However, the function of TDP-43 in motor neurons remains undefined. Here we use both gain- and loss-of-function approaches to determine roles of TDP-43 in motor neurons. Mice expressing human TDP-43 in neurons exhibited growth retardation and premature death that are characterized by abnormal intranuclear inclusions composed of TDP-43 and fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS), and massive accumulation of mitochondria in TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons, lack of mitochondria in motor axon terminals, and immature neuromuscular junctions. Whereas an elevated level of TDP-43 disrupts the normal nuclear distribution of survival motor neuron (SMN)-associated Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs) in motor neurons, its absence prevents the formation of GEMs in the nuclei of these cells. Moreover, transcriptome-wide deep sequencing analysis revealed that a decrease in abundance of neurofilament transcripts contributed to the reduction of caliber of motor axons in TDP-43 mice. In concert, our findings indicate that TDP-43 participates in pathways critical for motor neuron physiology, including those that regulate the normal distributions of SMN-associated GEMs in the nucleus and mitochondria in the cytoplasm.},

@article{Gruber2016,
	abstract = {Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a general mechanism of transcript diversification in mammals, which has been recently linked to proliferative states and cancer. Different 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) isoforms interact with different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which modify the stability, translation, and subcellular localization of the corresponding transcripts. Although the heterogeneity of pre-mRNA 3′ end processing has been established with high-throughput approaches, the mechanisms that underlie systematic changes in 3′ UTR lengths remain to be characterized. Through a uniform analysis of a large number of 3′ end sequencing data sets, we have uncovered 18 signals, six of which are novel, whose positioning with respect to pre-mRNA cleavage sites indicates a role in pre-mRNA 3′ end processing in both mouse and human. With 3′ end sequencing we have demonstrated that the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), which binds the poly(U) motif whose frequency also peaks in the vicinity of polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites, has a genome-wide effect on poly(A) site usage. HNRNPC-regulated 3′ UTRs are enriched in ELAV-like RBP 1 (ELAVL1) binding sites and include those of the CD47 gene, which participate in the recently discovered mechanism of 3′ UTR–dependent protein localization (UDPL). Our study thus establishes an up-to-date, high-confidence catalog of 3′ end processing sites and poly(A) signals, and it uncovers an important role of HNRNPC in regulating 3′ end processing. It further suggests that U-rich elements mediate interactions with multiple RBPs that regulate different stages in a transcript's life cycle.},

	abstract = {The aggregation and mislocalization of RNA-binding proteins leads to the aberrant regulation of RNA metabolism and is a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. However, the pathological consequences of abnormal deposition of TDP-43 and other RNA-binding proteins remain unclear, as the specific molecular events that drive neurodegeneration have been difficult to identify and continue to be elusive. Here we provide novel insight into the complexity of the RNA-binding protein network by demonstrating that the inclusion of exon 17b in the SORT1 mRNA, a pathologically-relevant splicing event known to be regulated by TDP-43, is also considerably affected by additional RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNP L, PTB/nPTB and hnRNP A1/A2. Most importantly, the expression of hnRNP A1/A2 and PTB/nPTB is significantly altered in patients with frontotemporal dementia with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), indicating that perturbations in RNA metabolism and processing in FTLD-TDP is not exclusively driven by a loss of TDP-43 function. These results also suggest that a comprehensive assessment of the RNA-binding protein network will dramatically advance our current understanding of the role of TDP-43 in disease pathogenesis, as well as enhance both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.},

In contrast, whole genome sequencing allows the discovery of all genetic variants, but their significant number, coupled with a poor understanding of the non-coding genome, makes their prioritization challenging. Here, we demonstrate the power of directly sequencing transcriptomes by providing a genetic diagnosis for 11{\%} (5 of 47) of unsolved mitochondrial disease patients and strong candidates for other patients. We found a median of 1 aberrantly expressed gene, 5 aberrant splicing events, and 6 mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and established disease-causing roles for each kind. Private exons often arose from sites that are weakly spliced in other individuals, providing an important clue for future variant prioritization. One such intronic exon-creating variant was found in three unrelated families in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1, which we consequently established as a novel disease-associated gene. In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants of Mendelian disorders and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.},

Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy.

	abstract = {The auxiliary factor of U2 small nuclear RNA (U2AF) is a heterodimer consisting of 65- and 35-kD proteins that bind the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) and AG dinucleotides at the 3' splice site (3'ss). The gene encoding U2AF35 (U2AF1) is alternatively spliced, giving rise to two isoforms U2AF35a and U2AF35b. Here, we knocked down U2AF35 and each isoform and characterized transcriptomes of HEK293 cells with varying U2AF35/U2AF65 and U2AF35a/b ratios. Depletion of both isoforms preferentially modified alternative RNA processing events without widespread failure to recognize 3'ss or constitutive exons. Over a third of differentially used exons were terminal, resulting largely from the use of known alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites. Intronic APA sites activated in depleted cultures were mostly proximal whereas tandem 3'UTR APA was biased toward distal sites. Exons upregulated in depleted cells were preceded by longer AG exclusion zones and PPTs than downregulated or control exons and were largely activated by PUF60 and repressed by CAPER$\alpha$. The U2AF(35) repression and activation was associated with a significant interchange in the average probabilities to form single-stranded RNA in the optimal PPT and branch site locations and sequences further upstream. Although most differentially used exons were responsive to both U2AF subunits and their inclusion correlated with U2AF levels, a small number of transcripts exhibited distinct responses to U2AF35a and U2AF35b, supporting the existence of isoform-specific interactions. These results provide new insights into function of U2AF and U2AF35 in alternative RNA processing.},

It could not only pave the way for the discovery of valuable therapeutic targets but might also govern future concepts of pre-manifest disease modifying treatments. MicroRNAs are central regulators of transcriptome plasticity and participate in pathogenic cascades and/or mirror cellular adaptation to insults. We obtained comprehensive expression profiles of microRNAs in the serum of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, asymptomatic mutation carriers and healthy control subjects. We observed a strikingly homogenous microRNA profile in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that was largely independent from the underlying disease gene. Moreover, we identified 24 significantly downregulated microRNAs in pre-manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutation carriers up to two decades or more before the estimated time window of disease onset; 91.7{\%} of the downregulated microRNAs in mutation carriers overlapped with the patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a consensus sequence motif present in the vast majority of downregulated microRNAs identified in this study. Our data thus suggest specific common denominators regarding molecular pathogenesis of different amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes. We describe the earliest pathomolecular alterations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutation carriers known to date, which provide a basis for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and strongly argue for studies evaluating presymptomatic disease-modifying treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

	abstract = {The majority of the human genome consists of non-coding regions that have been called junk DNA. However, recent studies have unveiled that these regions contain cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, etc. These regulatory elements can play crucial roles in controlling gene expressions in specific cell types, conditions, and developmental stages. Disruption to these regions could contribute to phenotype changes. Precisely identifying regulatory elements is key to deciphering the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. Cis-regulatory events are complex processes that involve chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the interactions between them. The development of next-generation sequencing techniques has allowed us to capture these genomic features in depth. Applied analysis of genome sequences for clinical genetics has increased the urgency for detecting these regions. However, the complexity of cis-regulatory events and the deluge of sequencing data require accurate and efficient computational approaches, in particular, machine learning techniques. In this review, we describe machine learning approaches for predicting transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and promoters, primarily driven by next-generation sequencing data. Data sources are provided in order to facilitate testing of novel methods. The purpose of this review is to attract computational experts and data scientists to advance this field.},

This is accompanied by de-repression of a panel of both LINE and LTR families of RTEs, with somewhat different elements being active in response to hTDP-43 expression in glia versus neurons. hTDP-43 expression in glia causes an early and severe loss of control of a specific RTE, the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) gypsy. We demonstrate that gypsy causes the degenerative phenotypes in these flies because we are able to rescue the toxicity of glial hTDP-43 either by genetically blocking expression of this RTE or by pharmacologically inhibiting RTE reverse transcriptase activity. Moreover, we provide evidence that activation of DNA damage-mediated programmed cell death underlies both neuronal and glial hTDP-43 toxicity, consistent with RTE-mediated effects in both cell types. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which RTE activity contributes to neurodegeneration in TDP-43-mediated diseases such as ALS and FTLD.},

	abstract = {The global shortening of messenger RNAs through alternative polyadenylation (APA) that occurs during enhanced cellular proliferation represents an important, yet poorly understoodyju7 mechanism of regulated gene expression. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) truncation of growth-promoting mRNA transcripts that relieves intrinsic microRNA- and AU-rich-element-mediated repression has been observed to correlate with cellular transformation; however, the importance to tumorigenicity of RNA 3'-end-processing factors that potentially govern APA is unknown. Here we identify CFIm25 as a broad repressor of proximal poly(A) site usage that, when depleted, increases cell proliferation. Applying a regression model on standard RNA-sequencing data for novel APA events, we identified at least 1,450 genes with shortened 3' UTRs after CFIm25 knockdown, representing 11{\%} of significantly expressed mRNAs in human cells. Marked increases in the expression of several known oncogenes, including cyclin D1, are observed as a consequence of CFIm25 depletion. Importantly, we identified a subset of CFIm25-regulated APA genes with shortened 3' UTRs in glioblastoma tumours that have reduced CFIm25 expression. Downregulation of CFIm25 expression in glioblastoma cells enhances their tumorigenic properties and increases tumour size, whereas CFIm25 overexpression reduces these properties and inhibits tumour growth. These findings identify a pivotal role of CFIm25 in governing APA and reveal a previously unknown connection between CFIm25 and glioblastoma tumorigenicity.},

	abstract = {Cryptic exons or pseudoexons are typically activated by point mutations that create GT or AG dinucleotides of new 5' or 3' splice sites in introns, often in repetitive elements. Here we describe two cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency caused by mutations improving the branch point sequence and polypyrimidine tracts of repeat-containing pseudoexons in the PTS gene. In the first case, we demonstrate a novel pathway of antisense Alu exonization, resulting from an intronic deletion that removed the poly(T)-tail of antisense AluSq. The deletion brought a favorable branch point sequence within proximity of the pseudoexon 3' splice site and removed an upstream AG dinucleotide required for the 3' splice site repression on normal alleles. New Alu exons can thus arise in the absence of poly(T)-tails that facilitated inclusion of most transposed elements in mRNAs by serving as polypyrimidine tracts, highlighting extraordinary flexibility of Alu repeats in shaping intron-exon structure. In the other case, a PTS pseudoexon was activated by an A{\textgreater}T substitution 9 nt upstream of its 3' splice site in a LINE-2 sequence, providing the first example of a disease-causing exonization of the most ancient interspersed repeat. These observations expand the spectrum of mutational mechanisms that introduce repetitive sequences in mature transcripts and illustrate the importance of intronic mutations in alternative splicing and phenotypic variability of hereditary disorders.},

Since conventional APA profiling has not been widely adopted, global cancer APA studies are very limited. Here we develop a novel bioinformatics algorithm (DaPars) for the de novo identification of dynamic APAs from standard RNA-seq. When applied to 358 TCGA Pan-Cancer tumour/normal pairs across seven tumour types, DaPars reveals 1,346 genes with recurrent and tumour-specific APAs. Most APA genes (91{\%}) have shorter 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs) in tumours that can avoid microRNA-mediated repression, including glutaminase (GLS), a key metabolic enzyme for tumour proliferation. Interestingly, selected APA events add strong prognostic power beyond common clinical and molecular variables, suggesting their potential as novel prognostic biomarkers. Finally, our results implicate CstF64, an essential polyadenylation factor, as a master regulator of 3'-UTR shortening across multiple tumour types.},

Results: We propose two new methods: IRcall and IRclassifier to detect IR events from RNA-Seq data. Our methods combine together gene expression information, read coverage within an intron, and read counts (within introns, within flanking exons, supporting splice junctions, and overlapping with 5' splice site/ 3' splice site), employing ranking strategy and classifiers to detect IR events. We applied our approaches to one published RNA-Seq data on contrasting skip mutant and wild-type in Arabidopsis thaliana. Compared with three state-of-the-art methods, IRcall and IRclassifier could effectively filter out false positives, and predict more accurate IR events.

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In the ALS motor neurons, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is dislocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm and forms inclusions, suggesting that loss of a nuclear function of TDP-43 may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. TDP-43 functions in RNA metabolism include regulation of transcription, mRNA stability, and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. However, a function of TDP-43 in tissue affected with ALS has not been elucidated. We sought to identify the molecular indicators reflecting on a TDP-43 function. Using exon array analysis, we observed a remarkable alteration of splicing in the polymerase delta interacting protein 3 (POLDIP3) as a result of the depletion of TDP-43 expression in two types of cultured cells. In the cells treated with TDP-43 siRNA, wild-type POLDIP3 (variant-1) decreased and POLDIP3 lacking exon 3 (variant-2) increased. The RNA binding ability of TDP-43 was necessary for inclusion of POLDIP3 exon 3. Moreover, we found an increment of POLDIP3 variant-2 mRNA in motor cortex, spinal cord and spinal motor neurons collected by laser capture microdissection with ALS. Our results suggest a loss of TDP-43 function in tissues affected with ALS, supporting the hypothesis that a loss of function of TDP-43 underlies the pathogenesis of ALS.},

These elements contain cryptic splice sites, so they are in constant danger of aberrant incorporation into mature transcripts. Despite posing a major threat to transcriptome integrity, little is known about the molecular mechanisms preventing their inclusion. Here, we present a mechanism for protecting the human transcriptome from the aberrant exonization of transposable elements. Quantitative iCLIP data show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNP C competes with the splicing factor U2AF65 at many genuine and cryptic splice sites. Loss of hnRNP C leads to formation of previously suppressed Alu exons, which severely disrupt transcript function. Minigene experiments explain disease-associated mutations in Alu elements that hamper hnRNP C binding. Thus, by preventing U2AF65 binding to Alu elements, hnRNP C plays a critical role as a genome-wide sentinel protecting the transcriptome.

TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. We demonstrated that a specific aminoacidic interval (216-315) in the C-terminal region and the RNA-recognition motif 1 domain are both implicated in TDP-43 participation in SGs as their deletion prevented the recruitment of TDP-43 into SGs. Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions. Although SGs were not evident in ALS brains, we speculate that an altered control of mRNA translation in stressful conditions may trigger motor neuron degeneration at early stages of the disease.},

The concurrent development in high-throughput profiling technology has further advanced our understanding of the impact of their dysregulation on a global scale. Currently, next-generation sequencing is the platform of choice for the discovery and quantification of miRNAs. Despite this, there is no clear consensus on how the data should be preprocessed before conducting downstream analyses. Often overlooked, data preprocessing is an essential step in data analysis: the presence of unreliable features and noise can affect the conclusions drawn from downstream analyses. Using a spike-in dilution study, we evaluated the effects of several general-purpose aligners (BWA, Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and Novoalign), and normalization methods (counts-per-million, total count scaling, upper quartile scaling, Trimmed Mean of M, DESeq, linear regression, cyclic loess and quantile) with respect to the final miRNA count data distribution, variance, bias and accuracy of differential expression analysis.

	abstract = {It is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from precursor messenger RNA transcripts. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic basis have not been examined. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'RS-exon' that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded from the dominant mRNA isoform owing to competition with a reconstituted 5' splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to reconstitute an efficient 5' splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes by coupling cryptic elements with inclusion of RS-exons.},

In Brief Membrane-less organelles generated through liquid-liquid phase separation play important roles in sub-cellular organization. Schmidt and Rohatgi find that an intrinsically disordered protein domain can nucleate the assembly of multi-phase liquid droplets with dynamic, vesicle-like internal vacuoles that approach the morphological complexity of membrane-bound structures like multi-vesicular bodies. SUMMARY Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-less organelles, including nucleoli and stress granules, that behave like liquid droplets. Such endogenous condensates often have internal substructure, but how this is es-tablished in the absence of membrane encapsulation remains unclear. We find that the N-and C-terminal domains of TDP43, a heterogeneous nuclear ribo-nucleoprotein implicated in neurodegenerative dis-eases, are capable of driving the formation of sub-structured liquid droplets in vivo. These droplets contain dynamic internal ''bubbles'' of nucleoplasm, reminiscent of membrane-based multi-vesicular en-dosomes. A conserved sequence embedded within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of TDP43 promotes the formation of these multi-phase assem-blies. Disease-causing point mutations in the IDR can change the propensity to form bubbles, protein dynamics within the phase, or phase-environment exchange rates. Our results show that a single IDR-containing protein can nucleate the assembly of compartmentalized liquid droplets approximating the morphological complexity of membrane-bound organelles.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An intronic GGGGCC-repeat expansion of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. The mechanism of neurodegeneration is unknown, but a direct effect on RNA processing mediated by RNA foci transcribed from the repeat sequence has been proposed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Gene expression profiling utilised total RNA extracted from motor neurons and lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human ALS patients, including those with an expansion of C9ORF72, and controls. In lymphoblastoid cell lines, expansion length and the frequency of sense and antisense RNA foci was also examined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Gene level analysis revealed a number of differentially expressed networks and both cell types exhibited dysregulation of a network functionally enriched for genes encoding 'RNA splicing' proteins. There was a significant overlap of these genes with an independently generated list of GGGGCC-repeat protein binding partners. At the exon level, in lymphoblastoid cells derived from C9ORF72-ALS patients splicing consistency was lower than in lines derived from non-C9ORF72 ALS patients or controls; furthermore splicing consistency was lower in samples derived from patients with faster disease progression. Frequency of sense RNA foci showed a trend towards being higher in lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients with shorter survival, but there was no detectable correlation between disease severity and DNA expansion length.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Up-regulation of genes encoding predicted binding partners of the C9ORF72 expansion is consistent with an attempted compensation for sequestration of these proteins. A number of studies have analysed changes in the transcriptome caused by C9ORF72 expansion, but to date findings have been inconsistent. As a potential explanation we suggest that dynamic sequestration of RNA processing proteins by RNA foci might lead to a loss of splicing consistency; indeed in our samples measurement of splicing consistency correlates with disease severity.},

We show that PolyA-seq is as accurate as existing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches for digital gene expression (DGE), enabling simultaneous mapping of polyA sites and quantitative measurement of their usage. In human, we confirmed 158,533 known sites and discovered 280,857 novel sites (FDR {\textless} 2.5{\%}). On average 10{\%} of novel human sites were also detected in matched tissues in other species. Most novel sites represent uncharacterized alternative polyA events and extensions of known transcripts in human and mouse, but primarily delineate novel transcripts in the other three species. A total of 69.1{\%} of known human genes that we detected have multiple polyA sites in their 3'UTRs, with 49.3{\%} having three or more. We also detected polyadenylation of noncoding and antisense transcripts, including constitutive and tissue-specific primary microRNAs. The canonical polyA signal was strongly enriched and positionally conserved in all species. In general, usage of polyA sites is more similar within the same tissues across different species than within a species. These quantitative maps of polyA usage in evolutionarily and functionally related samples constitute a resource for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying alternative polyadenylation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The initial next-generation sequencing technologies produced reads of 25 or 36 bp, and only from a single-end of the library sequence. Currently, it is possible to reliably produce 300 bp paired-end sequences for RNA expression analysis. While read lengths have consistently increased, people have assumed that longer reads are more informative and that paired-end reads produce better results than single-end reads. We used paired-end 101 bp reads and trimmed them to simulate different read lengths, and also separated the pairs to produce single-end reads. For each read length and paired status, we evaluated differential expression levels between two standard samples and compared the results to those obtained by qPCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that, with the exception of 25 bp reads, there is little difference for the detection of differential expression regardless of the read length. Once single-end reads are at a length of 50 bp, the results do not change substantially for any level up to, and including, 100 bp paired-end. However, splice junction detection significantly improves as the read length increases with 100 bp paired-end showing the best performance. We performed the same analysis on two ENCODE samples and found consistent results confirming that our conclusions have broad application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A researcher could save substantial resources by using 50 bp single-end reads for differential expression analysis instead of using longer reads. However, splicing detection is unquestionably improved by paired-end and longer reads. Therefore, an appropriate read length should be used based on the final goal of the study.},

Moreover, there is growing evidence to suggest that antisense transcription might have a key role in a range of human diseases. Consequently, there have been several recent attempts to identify novel NATs. To date, ∼2500 mammalian NATs have been found, indicating that antisense transcription might be a common mechanism of regulating gene expression in human cells. There are increasingly diverse ways in which antisense transcription can regulate gene expression and evidence for the involvement of NATs in human disease is emerging.

	abstract = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of systems biology, enabled by the advent of DNA microarrays. While this approach has literally transformed our vision and approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies by companies such as Roche (454 GS FLX), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB SOLiD) has completely transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude, making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many experimental approaches. One such method that has recently been developed uses MPS technology to directly survey the RNA content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional cloning associated with EST sequencing. This approach, called "RNA-seq", can generate quantitative expression scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative expression measures be made, but transcript structures including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also be identified.

Here, we describe Whippet, an easy-to-use RNA-seq analysis method that rapidly—with hardware requirements compatible with a laptop—models and quantifies AS events of any complexity without loss of accuracy. Using an entropic measure of splicing complexity, Whippet reveals that one-third of human protein coding genes produce transcripts with complex AS events involving co-expression of two or more principal splice isoforms. We observe that high-entropy AS events are more prevalent in tumor relative to matched normal tissues and correlate with increased expression of proto-oncogenic splicing factors. Whippet thus affords the rapid and accurate analysis of AS events of any complexity, and as such will facilitate future biomedical research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95{\%} credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

A large number of tools have been developed to tackle this problem, and we performed a comprehensive evaluation of these tools using both experimental and simulated RNA-seq datasets. We found that recently developed alignment-free tools are both fast and accurate. The accuracy of all methods was mainly influenced by the complexity of gene structures and caution must be taken when interpreting quantification results for short transcripts. Using TP53 gene simulation, we discovered that both sequencing depth and the relative abundance of different isoforms affect quantification accuracy Our comprehensive evaluation helps data analysts to make informed choice when selecting computational tools for isoform quantification.},

We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90{\%} of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

This may be especially true for ALS caused by a repeat expansion in C9orf72 (c9ALS), in which the accumulation of RNA foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins are expected to modify RNA metabolism. We report extensive alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) defects in the cerebellum of c9ALS subjects (8,224 AS and 1,437 APA), including changes in ALS-associated genes (for example, ATXN2 and FUS), and in subjects with sporadic ALS (sALS; 2,229 AS and 716 APA). Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNPH) and other RNA-binding proteins are predicted to be potential regulators of cassette exon AS events in both c9ALS and sALS. Co-expression and gene-association network analyses of gene expression and AS data revealed divergent pathways associated with c9ALS and sALS.},

	abstract = {In the genomic era, one of the fundamental goals is to characterize the function of proteins on a large scale. We describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of "books," each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.},

	abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly. Results We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (1) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs which permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (3) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete. Conclusions derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.

	abstract = {Mutations in the gene encoding the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from the majority of ‘sporadic' cases of ALS, establishing altered TDP-43 function and distribution as a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration. Transgenic mouse models in which TDP-43 is overexpressed only partially recapitulate the key cellular pathology of human ALS, but may also lead to non-specific toxicity. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of overexpression, and to maintain regulated spatio-temporal and cell-specific expression, we generated mice in which an 80 kb genomic fragment containing the intact human TDP-43 locus (either TDP-43WT or TDP-43M337V) and its regulatory regions was integrated into the Rosa26 (Gt(ROSA26)Sor) locus in a single copy. At 3 months of age, TDP-43M337V mice are phenotypically normal but by around 6 months develop progressive motor function deficits associated with loss of neuromuscular junction integrity, leading to a reduced lifespan. RNA sequencing shows that widespread mis-splicing is absent prior to the development of a motor phenotype, though differential expression analysis reveals a distinct transcriptional profile in pre-symptomatic TDP-43M337V spinal cords. Despite the presence of clear motor abnormalities, there was no evidence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in vivo at any timepoint. In primary embryonic spinal motor neurons and in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived motor neurons, mutant TDP-43 undergoes cytoplasmic mislocalisation, and is associated with altered stress granule assembly and dynamics. Overall, this mouse model provides evidence that ALS may arise through acquired TDP-43 toxicity associated with defective stress granule function. The normal phenotype until 6 months of age can facilitate the study of early pathways underlying ALS.},

	abstract = {Priming of random hexamers in cDNA synthesis is known to show sequence bias, but in addition it has been suggested recently that mismatches in random hexamer priming could be a cause of mismatches between the original RNA fragment and observed sequence reads. To explore random hexamer mispriming as a potential source of these errors, we analyzed two independently generated RNA-seq datasets of synthetic ERCC spikes for which the reference is known. First strand cDNA synthesized by random hexamer priming on RNA showed consistent position and nucleotide-specific mismatch errors in the first seven nucleotides. The mismatch errors found in both datasets are consistent in distribution and thermodynamically stable mismatches are more common. This strongly indicates that RNA-DNA mispriming of specific random hexamers causes these errors. Due to their consistency and specificity, mispriming errors can have profound implications for downstream applications if not dealt with properly.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing is an important biological process in the generation of multiple functional transcripts from the same genomic sequences. Differential analysis of splice junctions (SJs) and intron retentions (IRs) is helpful in the detection of alternative splicing events. In this study, we conducted differential analysis of SJs and IRs by use of DEXSeq, a Bioconductor package originally designed for differential exon usage analysis in RNA-seq data analysis. We set up an analysis pipeline including mapping of RNA-seq reads, the preparation of count tables of SJs and IRs as the input files, and the differential analysis in DEXSeq. We analyzed the public RNA-seq datasets generated from RNAi experiments on Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells to deplete RNA-binding proteins (GSE18508). The analysis confirmed previous findings on the alternative splicing of the trol and Ant2 (sesB) genes in the CG8144 (ps)-depletion experiment and identified some new alternative splicing events in other RNAi experiments. We also identified IRs that were confirmed in our SJ analysis. The proposed method used in our study can output the genomic coordinates of differentially used SJs and thus enable sequence motif search. Sequence motif search and gene func-tion annotation analysis helped us infer the underlying mechanism in alternative splicing events. To further evaluate this method, we also applied the method to public RNA-seq data from human breast cancer (GSE45419) and the plant Arabidopsis (SRP008262). In conclu-sion, our study showed that DEXSeq can be adapted to differential analysis of SJs and IRs, which will facilitate the identification of alternative splicing events and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of transcription processes and disease development.},

Replacement of murine FUS with mutant, but not wild-type, human FUS causes stress-mediated induction of chaperones, decreased expression of ion channels and transporters essential for synaptic function, and reduced synaptic activity without loss of nuclear FUS or its cytoplasmic aggregation. Most strikingly, accumulation of mutant human FUS is shown to activate an integrated stress response and to inhibit local, intra-axonal protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons and sciatic nerves. Collectively, our evidence demonstrates that human ALS/FTD-linked mutations in FUS induce a gain of toxicity that includes stress-mediated suppression in intra-axonal translation, synaptic dysfunction, and progressive age-dependent motor and cognitive disease without cytoplasmic aggregation, altered nuclear localization, or aberrant splicing of FUS-bound pre-mRNAs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {FUS mislocalisation and cytoplasmic aggregation are hallmark pathologies in FUS-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Many of the mechanistic hypotheses have focused on a loss of nuclear function in the FUS-opathies, implicating dysregulated RNA transcription and splicing in driving neurodegeneration. Recent studies describe an additional somato-dendritic localisation for FUS in the cerebral cortex implying a regulatory role in mRNA transport and local translation at the synapse. Here, we report that FUS is also abundant at the pre-synaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), suggesting an important function for this protein at peripheral synapses. We have previously reported dose and age-dependent motor neuron degeneration in transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type FUS, resulting in a motor phenotype detected by ∼28 days and death by ∼100 days. Now we report the earliest structural events using electron microscopy and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Mitochondrial abnormalities in the pre-synaptic motor nerve terminals are detected at postnatal day 6, which are more pronounced at P15 and accompanied by a loss of synaptic vesicles and synaptophysin protein coupled with NMJs of a smaller size at a time when there is no detectable motor neuron loss. These changes occur in the presence of abundant FUS and support a peripheral toxic gain of function. This appearance is typical of a 'dying-back' axonopathy, with the earliest manifestation being mitochondrial disruption. These findings support our hypothesis that FUS has an important function at the NMJ, and challenge the 'loss of nuclear function' hypothesis for disease pathogenesis in the FUS-opathies.},

Patient-derived MNs show typical cytoplasmic FUS pathology, hypoexcitability, as well as progressive axonal transport defects. Axonal transport defects are rescued by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic correction of the FUS mutation in patient-derived iPSCs. Moreover, these defects are reproduced by expressing mutant FUS in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), whereas knockdown of endogenous FUS has no effect, confirming that these pathological changes are mutant FUS dependent. Pharmacological inhibition as well as genetic silencing of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) increase $\alpha$-tubulin acetylation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondrial overlay, and restore the axonal transport defects in patient-derived MNs.},

	abstract = {We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the four different forms of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) and have analyzed the structure of the MBP gene. The three larger forms of MBP differ from the smallest by the inclusion of either or both of two short amino acid sequences at positions 57 and 124 of the smallest protein. The mouse genome contains a single MBP gene comprised of seven exons. The two amino acid sequences present only in the larger MBPs are encoded by separate exons. Furthermore, all exons in the coding region begin or end in complete codons so that alternative splicing does not alter the reading frame. We conclude that the four forms of this myelin protein are encoded in separate mRNAs, each derived by a simple alternative splicing of the primary MBP gene transcript. Comparison of the amino acid sequence encoded by each exon with a recent model of the secondary structure of MBP suggests that each of the seven exons encodes one or two of the predicted structural motifs of the protein. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope,branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5' terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5' tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA. Thus, four segments of viral RNA may be joined together during the synthesis of mature hexon mRNA.

We describe a novel filtering pipeline that identifies previously unannotated but high-quality transcript isoforms.

Here, we propose a new approach to define and quantify mRNA splicing in units of local splicing variations (LSVs). LSVs capture previously defined types of alternative splicing as well as more complex transcript variations. Building the first genome wide map of LSVs from twelve mouse tissues, we find complex LSVs constitute over 30{\%} of tissue dependent transcript variations and affect specific protein families. We show the prevalence of complex LSVs is conserved in humans and identify hundreds of LSVs that are specific to brain subregions or altered in Alzheimer's patients. Amongst those are novel isoforms in the Camk2 family and a novel poison exon in Ptbp1, a key splice factor in neurogenesis. We anticipate the approach presented here will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype, and disease.},

	abstract = {Auxiliary splicing signals play a major role in the regulation of constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, but their relative importance in selection of mutation-induced cryptic or de novo splice sites is poorly understood. Here, we show that exonic sequences between authentic and aberrant splice sites that were activated by splice-site mutations in human disease genes have lower frequencies of splicing enhancers and higher frequencies of splicing silencers than average exons. Conversely, sequences between authentic and intronic aberrant splice sites have more enhancers and less silencers than average introns. Exons that were skipped as a result of splice-site mutations were smaller, had lower SF2/ASF motif scores, a decreased availability of decoy splice sites and a higher density of silencers than exons in which splice-site mutation activated cryptic splice sites. These four variables were the strongest predictors of the two aberrant splicing events in a logistic regression model. Elimination or weakening of predicted silencers in two reporters consistently promoted use of intron-proximal splice sites if these elements were maintained at their original positions, with their modular combinations producing expected modification of splicing. Together, these results show the existence of a gradient in exon and intron definition at the level of pre-mRNA splicing and provide a basis for the development of computational tools that predict aberrant splicing outcomes.},

Thus, most of the many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease have unknown mechanism. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance—deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce an open source package Basset (https://github.com/davek44/Basset) to apply deep CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between two variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell???s chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) generates vast transcriptomic and proteomic complexity. However, which of the myriad of detected AS events provide important biological functions is not well understood. Here, we define the largest program of functionally coordinated, neural-regulated AS described to date in mammals. Relative to all other types of AS within this program, 3-15 nucleotide "microexons" display the most striking evolutionary conservation and switch-like regulation. These microexons modulate the function of interaction domains of proteins involved in neurogenesis. Most neural microexons are regulated by the neuronal-specific splicing factor nSR100/SRRM4, through its binding to adjacent intronic enhancer motifs. Neural microexons are frequently misregulated in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and this misregulation is associated with reduced levels of nSR100. The results thus reveal a highly conserved program of dynamic microexon regulation associated with the remodeling of protein-interaction networks during neurogenesis, the misregulation of which is linked to autism.},

	abstract = {Identification of functional genetic variants and elucidation of their regulatory mechanisms represent significant challenges of the post-genomic era. A poorly understood topic is the involvement of genetic variants in mediating post-transcriptional RNA processing, including alternative splicing. Thus far, little is known about the genomic, evolutionary and regulatory features of genetically modulated alternative splicing (GMAS). Here, we systematically identified intronic tag variants for genetic modulation of alternative splicing using RNA-seq data specific to cellular compartments. Combined with our previous method that identifies exonic tags for GMAS, this study yielded 622 GMAS exons. We observed that GMAS events are highly cell-type independent, indicating that splicing-altering genetic variants could have widespread function across cell types. Interestingly, GMAS genes, exons and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) all demonstrated positive selection or accelerated evolution in primates. We predicted that GMAS SNVs often alter binding of splicing factors, with SRSF1 affecting the most GMAS events and demonstrating global allelic binding bias. However, in contrast to their GMAS targets, the predicted splicing factors are more conserved than expected, suggesting that cis-regulatory variation is the major driving force of splicing evolution. Moreover, GMAS-related splicing factors had stronger consensus motifs than expected, consistent with their susceptibility to SNV-disruption. Intriguingly, GMAS SNVs in general do not alter the strongest consensus position of the splicing factor motif, except the {\textgreater}100 GMAS SNVs in linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms reported by genome-wide association studies. Our study reports many GMAS events and enables a better understanding of the evolutionary and regulatory features of this phenomenon.},

Although being intronic, the expansion is translated into five different dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) that accumulate within patients' neurons. Attempts have been made to model DPRs in cell and animals. However, the majority of these use DPRs repeat numbers much shorter than those observed in patients. To address this we have generated a selection of DPR expression constructs with repeat numbers in excess of 1000 repeats, matching what is seen in patients. Small and larger DPRs produce inclusions with similar morphology but different cellular effects. We demonstrate a length dependent effect using electrophysiology with a phenotype only occurring with the longest DPRs. These data highlight the importance of using physiologically relevant repeat numbers when modelling DPRs.},

	abstract = {The contribution of pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to the regulation of immune responses remains poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. We sought to investigate the role of mRNA processing in the cellular responses of human macrophages to live bacterial infections. Here, we used mRNA sequencing to quantify gene expression and isoform abundances in primary macrophages from 60 individuals, before and after infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. In response to both bacteria we identified thousands of genes that significantly change isoform usage in response to infection, characterized by an overall increase in isoform diversity after infection. In response to both bacteria, we found global shifts towards (i) the inclusion of cassette exons and (ii) shorter 3' UTRs, with near-universal shifts towards usage of more upstream polyadenylation sites. Using complementary data collected in non-human primates, we show that these features are evolutionarily conserved among primates. Following infection, we identify candidate RNA processing factors whose expression is associated with individual-specific variation in isoform abundance. Finally, by profiling microRNA levels, we show that 3' UTRs with reduced abundance after infection are significantly enriched for target sites for particular miRNAs. These results suggest that the pervasive usage of shorter 3' UTRs is a mechanism for particular genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs. Collectively, our results suggest that dynamic changes in RNA processing may play key roles in the regulation of innate immune responses.},

Second, we find that association between TDP-43 and many of its TE targets is reduced in FTLD patients. Third, we discovered that a large fraction of the TEs to which TDP-43 binds become de-repressed in mouse TDP-43 disease models. We propose the hypothesis that TE mis-regulation contributes to TDP-43 related neurodegenerative diseases.},

Mutations in the FUS gene were identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the pathomechanisms by which these mutations cause ALS are not known. Here, we show that FUS interacts with the minor spliceosome constituent U11 snRNP, binds preferentially to minor introns and directly regulates their removal. Furthermore, a FUS knockout in neuroblastoma cells strongly disturbs the splicing of minor intron-containing mRNAs, among them mRNAs required for action potential transmission and for functional spinal motor units. Moreover, an ALS-associated FUS mutant that forms cytoplasmic aggregates inhibits splicing of minor introns by trapping U11 and U12 snRNAs in these aggregates. Collectively, our findings suggest a possible pathomechanism for ALS in which mutated FUS inhibits correct splicing of minor introns in mRNAs encoding proteins required for motor neuron survival.},

To better understand FUS function in vivo, we examined the consequences of disrupting Fus in mice. Our results indicate that Fus is essential for viability of neonatal animals, influences lymphocyte development in a non-cell-intrinsic manner, has an intrinsic role in the proliferative responses of B cells to specific mitogenic stimuli and is required for the maintenance of genomic stability.

We demonstrated that FUS is a repressor of exon 7 splicing and that the exon 7-skipped splice variant is subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Overexpression of FUS led to the repression of exon 7 splicing and a reduction of endogenous FUS protein. Conversely, the repression of exon 7 was reduced by knockdown of FUS protein, and moreover, it was rescued by expression of EGFP-FUS. This dynamic regulation of alternative splicing describes a novel mechanism of FUS autoregulation. Given that ALS-associated FUS mutants are deficient in nuclear localization, we examined whether cells expressing these mutants would be deficient in repressing exon 7 splicing. We showed that FUS harbouring R521G, R522G or $\Delta$Exon15 mutation (minor, moderate or severe cytoplasmic localization, respectively) directly correlated with respectively increasing deficiencies in both exon 7 repression and autoregulation of its own protein levels. These data suggest that compromised FUS autoregulation can directly exacerbate the pathogenic accumulation of cytoplasmic FUS protein in ALS. We showed that exon 7 skipping can be induced by antisense oligonucleotides targeting its flanking splice sites, indicating the potential to alleviate abnormal cytoplasmic FUS accumulation in ALS. Taken together, FUS autoregulation by alternative splicing provides insight into a molecular mechanism by which FUS-regulated pre-mRNA processing can impact a significant number of targets important to neurodegeneration.},

We sequenced the genes encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP) and FUS in 99 sporadic and 17 familial ALS patients ascertained at Mayo Clinic. We identified two novel mutations in FUS in two out of 99 (2.0{\%}) sporadic ALS patients and established the de novo occurrence of one FUS mutation. In familial patients, we identified three (17.6{\%}) SOD1 mutations, while FUS and TARDBP mutations were excluded. The de novo FUS mutation (g.10747A{\textgreater}G; IVS13-2A{\textgreater}G) affects the splice-acceptor site of FUS intron 13 and was shown to induce skipping of FUS exon 14 leading to the C-terminal truncation of FUS (p.G466VfsX14). Subcellular localization studies showed a dramatic increase in the cytoplasmic localization of FUS and a reduction of normal nuclear expression in cells transfected with truncated compared to wild-type FUS. We further identified a novel in-frame insertion/deletion mutation in FUS exon 12 (p.S402{\_}P411delinsGGGG) which is predicted to expand a conserved poly-glycine motif. Our findings extend the mutation spectrum in FUS leading to ALS and describe the first de novo mutation in FUS.},

	doi = {10.1093/hmg/ddw337}, 
	abstract ={Splicing regulation is an important step of post-transcriptional gene regulation. It is a highly dynamic process orchestrated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBP dysfunction and global splicing dysregulation have been implicated in many human diseases, but the in vivo functions of most RBPs and the splicing outcome upon their loss remain largely unexplored. Here we report that constitutive deletion of Rbm17, which encodes an RBP with a putative role in splicing, causes early embryonic lethality in mice and that its loss in Purkinje neurons leads to rapid degeneration. Transcriptome profiling of Rbm17-deficient and control neurons and subsequent splicing analyses using CrypSplice, a new computational method that we developed, revealed that more than half of RBM17-dependent splicing changes are cryptic. Importantly, RBM17 represses cryptic splicing of genes that likely contribute to motor coordination and cell survival. This finding prompted us to re-analyze published datasets from a recent report on TDP-43, an RBP implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as it was demonstrated that TDP-43 represses cryptic exon splicing to promote cell survival. We uncovered a large number of TDP-43-dependent splicing defects that were not previously discovered, revealing that TDP-43 extensively regulates cryptic splicing. Moreover, we found a significant overlap in genes that undergo both RBM17- and TDP-43-dependent cryptic splicing repression, many of which are associated with survival. We propose that repression of cryptic splicing by RBPs is critical for neuronal health and survival.},

              protective but they are often associated with a loss of TDP-43
              from the nucleus and neurodegeneration may be caused by a loss of
              normal TDP-43 function or a gain of toxic function. Here we

              distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar
              amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are
              essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules.
              However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is
              not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of
              heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in
              families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain,

              lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform
              of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble
              into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease
              mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric
              zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of
              self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type
              hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess
              incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and
              drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models
              that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated
              polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a
              PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with
              PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of
              genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
              However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
              web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are
              routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and
              flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of
              these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This article
              introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation
              and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data
              (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also
              supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to
              both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and
              allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation
              sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation
              tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
              standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks
              as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions

              a canonical polypyrimidine tract within the intron 2/exon 3
              junction. Our previous studies demonstrated that the SR proteins

              There is a G-rich element in intron 2 that interacts with hnRNPH1

              accurate detection of intron retention (IR) events from RNA-Seq

              IRcall and IRclassifier to detect IR events from RNA-Seq data.
              Our methods combine together gene expression information, read
              coverage within an intron, and read counts (within introns,
              within flanking exons, supporting splice junctions, and
              overlapping with 5' splice site/ 3' splice site), employing

              survey of 78 mutation-induced cryptic exons previously identified
              in 51 disease genes revealed the presence of TEs in 40 cases
              (51\%). Most TE-containing exons were derived from short
              interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), with Alus and mammalian
              interspersed repeats (MIRs) covering >18 and >16\% of the
              exonized sequences, respectively. The majority of SINE-derived
              cryptic exons had splice sites at the same positions of the
              Alu/MIR consensus as existing SINE exons and their inclusion in
              the mRNA was facilitated by phylogenetically conserved changes
              that improved both traditional and auxiliary splicing signals,
              thus marking intronic TEs amenable for pathogenic exonization.
              The overrepresentation of MIRs among TE exons is likely to result
              from their high average exon inclusion levels, which reflect
              their strong splice sites, a lack of splicing silencers and a
              high density of enhancers, particularly (G)AA(G) motifs. These

	abstract = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples. Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program, replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94{\%}) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an effective approach to account for variability, and the result is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will be useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse RNA-Seq projects.},

T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) and TIA1-like 1 (TIAL1) locally enhance exon inclusion by recruiting U1 snRNP to 5' splice sites. However, effects of TIA proteins on splicing of distal exons have not yet been explored. We used UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to find that TIA1 and TIAL1 bind at the same positions on human RNAs. Binding downstream of 5' splice sites was used to predict the effects of TIA proteins in enhancing inclusion of proximal exons and silencing inclusion of distal exons. The predictions were validated in an unbiased manner using splice-junction microarrays, RT-PCR, and minigene constructs, which showed that TIA proteins maintain splicing fidelity and regulate alternative splicing by binding exclusively downstream of 5' splice sites. Surprisingly, TIA binding at 5' splice sites silenced distal cassette and variable-length exons without binding in proximity to the regulated alternative 3' splice sites. Using transcriptome-wide high-resolution mapping of TIA-RNA interactions we evaluated the distal splicing effects of TIA proteins. These data are consistent with a model where TIA proteins shorten the time available for definition of an alternative exon by enhancing recognition of the preceding 5' splice site. Thus, our findings indicate that changes in splicing kinetics could mediate the distal regulation of alternative splicing.},

We have combined bioinformatics, biochemistry and genetics to derive an RNA map describing the rules by which Nova proteins regulate alternative splicing. This map revealed that the position of Nova binding sites (YCAY clusters) in a pre-messenger RNA determines the outcome of splicing. The map correctly predicted Nova's effect to inhibit or enhance exon inclusion, which led us to examine the relationship between the map and Nova's mechanism of action. Nova binding to an exonic YCAY cluster changed the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) binding and exon inclusion, whereas Nova binding to an intronic YCAY cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. Assays of splicing intermediates of Nova-regulated transcripts in mouse brain revealed that Nova preferentially regulates removal of introns harbouring (or closest to) YCAY clusters. These results define a genome-wide map relating the position of a cis-acting element to its regulation by an RNA binding protein, namely that Nova binding to YCAY clusters results in a local and asymmetric action to regulate spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing in neurons.},

              dysfunction, paralysis, and death. Although multiple causes have
              been identified for this disease, >95\% of ALS cases show
              aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43)
              accompanied by its nuclear depletion. Therefore, the TDP-43
              pathology may be a converging point in the pathogenesis that
              originates from various initial triggers. The aggregation is
              thought to result from TDP-43 misfolding, which could generate
              cellular toxicity. However, the aggregation as well as the
              nuclear depletion could also lead to a partial loss of TDP-43
              function or TDP-43 dysfunction. To investigate the impact of
              TDP-43 dysfunction, we generated a transgenic mouse model for a
              partial loss of TDP-43 function using transgenic RNAi. These mice
              show ubiquitous transgene expression and TDP-43 knockdown in both
              the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Strikingly,
              these mice develop progressive neurodegeneration prominently in
              cortical layer V and spinal ventral horn, motor dysfunction,
              paralysis, and death. Furthermore, examination of splicing
              patterns of TDP-43 target genes in human ALS revealed changes
              consistent with TDP-43 dysfunction. These results suggest that
              the CNS, particularly motor neurons, possess a heightened
              vulnerability to TDP-43 dysfunction. Additionally, because TDP-43
              knockdown predominantly occur in astrocytes in the spinal cord of
              these mice, our results suggest that TDP-43 dysfunction in
              astrocytes is an important driver for motor neuron degeneration

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              \texttimes{} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR

              used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic

              reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but
              not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the

              of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in
              either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We
              consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this
              problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on
              exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic
              evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been
              implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on
              extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably

              appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low

              predominantly nuclear location to ubiquitin-positive, cytoplasmic
              foci. The extent to which TDP-43 drives pathophysiology is

	abstract = {RNA localization pathways direct numerous mRNAs to distinct subcellular regions and affect many physiological processes. In one such pathway the tumor-suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) targets RNAs to cell protrusions, forming APC-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (APC-RNPs). Here, we show that APC-RNPs associate with the RNA-binding protein Fus/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma). Fus is not required for APC-RNP localization but is required for efficient translation of associated transcripts. Labeling of newly synthesized proteins revealed that Fus promotes translation preferentially within protrusions. Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules. We show that overexpression or mutation of Fus results in formation of granules, which preferentially recruit APC-RNPs. Remarkably, these granules are not translationally silent. Instead, APC-RNP transcripts are translated within cytoplasmic Fus granules. These results unexpectedly show that translation can occur within stress-like granules. Importantly, they identify a new local function for cytoplasmic Fus with implications for ALS pathology.},

              disease with no effective treatment available. An increasing
              number of genetic causes of ALS are being identified, but how
              these genetic defects lead to motor neuron degeneration and to
              which extent they affect common cellular pathways remains
              incompletely understood. To address these questions, we performed

              C9orf72, FUS, OPTN, TDP-43 and UBQLN2 in neuronal cells. This
              analysis identified several known but also many novel binding
              partners of these proteins. Interactomes of WT and mutant ALS
              proteins were very similar except for OPTN and UBQLN2, in which
              mutations caused loss or gain of protein interactions. Several of
              the identified interactomes showed a high degree of overlap:
              shared binding partners of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43 had roles in RNA
              metabolism; OPTN- and UBQLN2-interacting proteins were related to
              protein degradation and protein transport, and C9orf72
              interactors function in mitochondria. To confirm that this
              overlap is important for ALS pathogenesis, we studied fragile X
              mental retardation protein (FMRP), one of the common interactors
              of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43, in more detail in in vitro and in vivo
              model systems for FUS ALS. FMRP localized to mutant
              FUS-containing aggregates in spinal motor neurons and bound

              junction integrity, and motor behavior caused by mutant FUS in
              zebrafish embryos, could be rescued by exogenous FMRP expression.
              Together, these results show that interactomics analysis can

              genes by TE-derived sequences has been observed in specific
              contexts, but has yet to be systematically and comprehensively
              investigated. Here, we study a collection of 75 CLIP-Seq
              experiments mapping the RNA binding sites for a diverse set of 51
              human proteins to explore the role of TEs in post-transcriptional
              regulation of human mRNAs and lncRNAs via RNA-protein
              interactions. RESULTS: We detect widespread interactions between
              RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and many families of TE-derived
              sequence in the CLIP-Seq data. Further, alignment coverage peaks
              on specific positions of the TE consensus sequences, illuminating
              a diversity of TE-specific RBP binding motifs. Evidence of
              binding and conservation of these motifs in the nonrepetitive
              transcriptome suggests that TEs have generally appropriated
              existing sequence preferences of the RBPs. Depletion assays for
              numerous RBPs show that TE-derived binding sites affect
              transcript abundance and splicing similarly to nonrepetitive
              sites. However, in a few cases the effect of RBP binding depends
              on the specific TE family bound; for example, the ubiquitously
              expressed RBP HuR confers transcript stability unless bound to an
              Alu element. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests a widespread

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Reliable exon recognition is key to the splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein whose nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation are a hallmark pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43 depletion causes the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons into a range of transcripts, but their extent, relevance to disease pathogenesis and whether they are caused by other RNA-binding proteins implicated in ALS/FTD are unknown. METHODS We developed an analysis pipeline to discover and quantify cryptic exon inclusion and applied it to publicly available human and murine RNA-sequencing data. RESULTS We detected widespread cryptic splicing in TDP-43 depletion datasets but almost none in another ALS/FTD-linked protein FUS. Sequence motif and iCLIP analysis of cryptic exons demonstrated that they are bound by TDP-43. Unlike the cryptic exons seen in hnRNP C depletion, those repressed by TDP-43 cannot be linked to transposable elements. Cryptic exons are poorly conserved and inclusion overwhelmingly leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the host transcript, with reduced transcript levels observed in differential expression analysis. RNA-protein interaction data on 73 different RNA-binding proteins showed that, in addition to TDP-43, 7 specifically bind TDP-43 linked cryptic exons. This suggests that TDP-43 competes with other splicing factors for binding to cryptic exons and can repress cryptic exon inclusion. CONCLUSIONS Our quantitative analysis pipeline confirms the presence of cryptic exons during the depletion of TDP-43 but not FUS providing new insight into to RNA-processing dysfunction as a cause or consequence in ALS/FTD.},

              ∼1,000-fold, decreasing discarded PCR duplicate reads by ∼60\%
              while maintaining single-nucleotide binding resolution. By
              simplifying the generation of paired IgG and size-matched input
              controls, eCLIP improves specificity in the discovery of
              authentic binding sites. We generated 102 eCLIP experiments for
              73 diverse RBPs in HepG2 and K562 cells (available at
              https://www.encodeproject.org), demonstrating that eCLIP enables
              large-scale and robust profiling, with amplification and sample
              requirements similar to those of ChIP-seq. eCLIP enables
              integrative analysis of diverse RBPs to reveal factor-specific
              profiles, common artifacts for CLIP and RNA-centric perspectives
              on RBP activity.",

              Classical splicing mutations (type I) delete entire exons during
              pre-mRNA splicing. In this report, we describe nine examples of
              nonclassical splicing mutations in 12 A-T patients and compare
              cDNA changes to estimates of splice junction strengths based on
              maximum entropy modeling. These mutations fall into three
              categories: pseudoexon insertions (type II), single nucleotide
              changes within the exon (type III), and intronic changes that
              disrupt the conserved 3' splice sequence and lead to partial exon
              deletion (type IV). Four patients with a previously reported type
              II (pseudoexon) mutation all shared a common founder haplotype.
              Three patients with apparent missense or silent mutations
              actually had type III aberrant splicing and partial deletion of
              an exon. Five patients had type IV mutations that could have been
              misinterpreted as classical splicing mutations. Instead, their
              mutations disrupt a splice site and use another AG splice site
              located nearby within the exon; they lead to partial deletions at
              the beginning of exons. These nonclassical splicing mutations
              create frameshifts that result in premature termination codons.
              Without screening cDNA or using accurate models of splice site
              strength, the consequences of these genomic mutations cannot be
              reliably predicted. This may lead to further misinterpretation of
              genotype-phenotype correlations and may subsequently impact upon
