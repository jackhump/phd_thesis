I am incredibly grateful for the support given to me by my three supervisors and credit them with making my PhD experience an enjoyable and rewarding one. I would like to thank all members of the Fratta, Isaacs, Plagnol and Ule labs for their assistance and lively discussion. In particular I'd like to single out Warren Emmett for teaching me everything there is to know about RNA-seq and life in general. I am extremely grateful to the Cleveland, Gravely, Wong, Ule and Yeo labs for making all their data freely available for me to parasite off. I also wish to thank my partner Aliss for making sure my work does not completely rule my life.
